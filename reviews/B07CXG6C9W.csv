Sir Mike,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGRH2RZZ5BZ7ORPNMHV53MNZSFKA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,Pinhole Bright Spots and Other Issues,3,Verified Purchase,Digital Storage Capacity: 8Offer Type: With Special OffersColor: BlackOption: Without Kindle Unlimited,"I have owned a Kindle Paperwhite since 2014. I really liked that old one and gifted it away a while ago. Perhaps I have had too much expectation for this new 2018 version (waited for many months for the release), I felt quite disappointed with a few of its issues.First I must be clear that I am a fan of e-books, and I think Kindle Paperwhite has always been a nice device, light, easy to use, easier on the eyes than an LCD screen, easy to look up words, etc. I also used a Kindle Oasis for a couple of days, I don't feel comfortable with the hard slick aluminum back, and its front lights are located on the sides, so the slight uneven light can be observed from left to right; while for Paperwhite with bottom lights, the unevenness is from top to bottom, meaning within each text line, the light is usually even, therefore less distracting to reading.Here comes the new 2018 Paperwhite:I like the screen is flat with the bezels now. However, both the first device I received and the subsequent replacement have a bright pinhole dot under the screen (see photos). It's like a piece of tiny defect or dust above the e-ink text and located in the light distribution layer (my guess). When the front light is adjusted to a high level, the dot becomes quite bright and distracting. I was surprised the second device had the same issue (just my luck or something else is going on here?), but because it's near the corner, I decided to live with it. This pinhole bright spot issue apparently can be found on the previous generations as well based on many reviews, I am just astonished Amazon hasn't fixed it.Also, I don't know what happened with the charging cable, it took me a lot of effort to plug it into the device, and pull it out, it's like as if the connectors are not made well.(Update Jan 26, 2019: the difficulty of plugging in the cable only occurred during the first couple of uses, it became normal and smooth later.)Also, the screen feels easier to smudge than my old Paperwhite. The texts appear slightly blurrier where there are fingerprints.Another issue is that the screen has a ton of reflection from bright windows or light sources (please see my photo, taken under an east-facing window in the afternoon). I don’t remember if it has always been like this or it’s because of the new screen update. Even with the window blinds shut, I had to tilt Kindle to certain angles to avoid the glare, albeit softer than on an LCD screen, still quite distracting. Under the same lighting, a real paperback has no reflection glare issues.Furthermore, when front light is on and when external ambient light is somewhat dim, my replacement Kindle Paperwhite appears a bit yellower near the bottom, especially on the left side, it’s distracting but hopefully I’ll get used to it. It’s like real paper books getting old and parts of pages turning yellow—I try to convince myself.(Update Jan 26, 2019: other reviewers have mentioned issues with poor battery life. My experience is similar that if I don't use it for a few hours, even with WiFi turned on, the device will enter something like a hibernation mode, which requires a bit more time to wake up, but it allows the battery to last for many weeks if left on the shelf. If I read about 1-2 hours a day with wifi on, the battery drains very quickly, and will hardly last beyond a week. However, If you keep airplane mode on during reading, it will significantly conserve battery, the only inconvenience is that if you don't know a word and the dictionary also doesn't have it, which is quite likely the case, Wikipedia won't be able to show up without WiFi.)Perhaps I’m just asking too much for a digital device. Overall, it’s still a great device to read books, and Amazon still provided a fast replacement when I asked. However, with these experiences, I can no longer swear to e-readers. I don’t write reviews often, but I feel strongly about this product and sincerely hope it will help fellow costumers and help Amazon improve their devices.",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/R37BPUYIJU2HP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"November 12, 2018","3,241"

Hinrichsen  II,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFQQ443QSHAQAKHBUCK56IG2JP4A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,"Works fine, replaces a Gen 3.",3,Verified Purchase,Digital Storage Capacity: 8Offer Type: With Special OffersColor: BlackOption: Without Kindle Unlimited,"If you own an earlier Paperwhite and it's still functional there is no compelling reason to buy the Gen 4 ""All-New"" Paperwhite ( Amazon misleadingly refers to this as ""10th Generation"". It's a 10th generation Kindle e-reader but only the 4th generation Paperwhite ) unless a limited degree of water resistance (not waterproof as they claim) is important to you or you want Bluetooth capability for Audiobooks. Neither of these are remotely important nor needed by me in an e-reader and Audiobooks are handled better by smaller, lighter and less power hungry devices. The additional storage is coals to Newcastle as Amazon's cloud can hold any overstorage needs an owner has. Personally, I don't know anyone who has ever run out of onboard storage on any Kindle, including the very first keyboard models, despite loading them with hundreds of books. The much touted, by Amazon, thinness and lightness of this edition is, in my opinion, overblown. Yes it is slightly thinner and slightly lighter but not paradigm changing. Also beware: the supplied micro USB cable packaged with mine will not fit into the device, maybe yours will. All in all I find it breathtakingly stupid and/or venal of Amazon to ship a device so poorly engineered and quality controlled as to not have a functional charging cable. I bought this Kindle solely to replace a Gen 3 whose battery was failing. Amazon took every other Paperwhite edition off the website and left no choice but this one at $10 more than the previous edition. It's a Kindle, it's fine, but it's no game changer.

This is my third PaperWhite version of the Kindle.  The battery life is non-existent.

If you disable the WiFi, the battery life lasts a bit longer (approx 3-days) using the device 2-3 hours a day.  The low rating is because of the very low battery life and inability to keep WiFi on all the time.  Otherwise, my Kindle is my best friend.

Rustic,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AF6E4B3NG2DELL5ZFWPPZ4W6UDNQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,A Review From 2 Perspectives,5,Verified Purchase,Digital Storage Capacity: 8Offer Type: With Special OffersColor: BlackOption: Without Kindle Unlimited,"I feel I need to approach this review from 2 perspectives:1. If you are somewhat new to the Kindle experience and you bought this one.2. If you are a previous Kindle or Paperwhite owner and upgraded to this one.If you are NEW TO THE EXPERIENCE or upgrading from an old Kindle like a Keyboard, welcome. This new Kindle merits 5 stars. You're going to love it. Here are some Kindle Paperwhite features you'll enjoy:* Built in light. Reading in bed while someone is trying to sleep next to you is now an easy joy.* Touch screen. Getting around your Kindle is easy. Turn pages, shop in the store, all by touching the screen.* Waterproof. This is a new feature to this Kindle. Bring it in the pool worry free!* Bluetooth. Sync this up with a speaker or headphones to have a book read to you.Besides that, this Kindle is thin and light. It doesn't fatigue your hand at all. The fonts are adjustable for size. The light is adjustable for brightness. The color of the light is somewhat grayish. My older Paperwhite had the blueish hue which I found a little unnatural. I bought the Amazon case and when you close the cover the Kindle automatically sleeps and when you open the cover it automatically wakes up. I find this Kindle to be a little faster than the previous version. If this is your first Paperwhite there is only reason to be content with your purchase.Now, if you are UPGRADING FROM AN OLDER PAPERWHITE I'd still be happy (I'm still glad I did upgrade) but there were a few things that made me go hmmmm.First off I expected this Kindle to have the latest software. It didn't. I'm waiting for the update where the home page scrolls and you could save font themes. Why doesn't a brand new Kindle not have the latest software? Not a deal breaker because I know the update will be coming, but my old Paperwhite was updated. Last time I checked the update page it didn't even show the update for this version. A little disappointing.Secondly, I had the Paperwhite from a few versions ago, the one with 212 ppi. Upgrading to this one with 300 ppi, I expected the font to be sharp, bold, and clear. Well, I'll just say that it didn't stink. Actually I found it to be a little greyed out, a little washed out to say it another way. Now, this is totally adjustable of course. The font could be bolded and size changed. But again, a little disappointed.The software is exactly the same as my older version, minus the upgrade of course. I wish Amazon would give us more fonts to choose from. I know that we could download fonts now but it would just be nice if they were built in to begin with.So my two biggest gripes are not shipped with the latest software and underwhelming font sharpness. From this perspective I'd give it a 3 1/2 or 4 star rating.But having said that I have no regrets upgrading at all. I would do it again. The Paperwhite experience in general is something I find amazing. When I'm finished with a book I go right to the store and check out samples, download free classics, or pull the trigger on a purchase based on my mood right then and there. I wouldn't trade it for anything.If you are new to Kindle or upgrading from a really old one don't let my gripes deter you. The Paperwhite is the gold standard of e-readers. At an affordable price you're getting this gold standard. And since this Kindle boasts being waterproof, bluetooth, being thinner and lighter, and with 8gb of storage, it's a no brainer.",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/R2XY07TH0HTFV1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"November 12, 2018",937

I started with the classic, moved to the one with a keyboard, and then the Paperwhite, and now the Paperwhite 2.0. I've now had it for five days. When I got it, I fully charged it.I haven't tested this in water, so the only thing I can put in the pros column is the increased storage. Otherwise, it seems exactly the same as the original Paperwhite. I don't want to return the device because I can work around the issues, but I also don't want to give it a great rating given the issues I've seen so far - hence the three stars.**Issues I had with the original Paperwhite that persist with this version:**1. Occasionally unresponsive screen. When pressing to go forward or back, the device will sometimes freeze for a second before performing the required command. Based on other reviews, I can only assume this is a device issue. I was hoping it would be fixed with this version, but apparently not.2. Battery doesn't meet marketing claims. I'll be clear upfront: I read a lot, and I read fast. I average three to five books a week, depending on the length of the book. 30% of my reading is done on my phone via Kindle app, and the other 70% is done on my Kindle.Amazon claims ""battery lasts weeks."" If you don't use the device, that may be true. If you do, though, I'd say it lasts about a week. In the five days I've had this device, I've spent about twenty hours reading on it. The battery is half gone, so I assume its full life is 40 hours. Not bad - if the marketing claim said that the battery lasts a week (singular). Again, not enough to make me return the device, but it's annoying - especially given the increased price.**Issues I had with the original Paperwhite that I haven't experienced with this version:**1. Struggling to open large documents or books and occasionally crashing and freezing when getting too far into the document.2. Slowing down when more books were downloaded. It performed best when only 8-10 books were downloaded on the device at a time and the others were cleared out.3. Fully charged battery running out after six consecutive hours of reading, requiring a recharge (annoying, given the ""weeks"" statement when it didn't even last a day).I'll update this review later to confirm if these last issues are resolved with this new version or if they crop up after more use.",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/R3GX5TCQ6ZDVI4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"November 22, 2018",679

Everything else is worse.,1,Verified Purchase,Digital Storage Capacity: 8Offer Type: With Special OffersColor: BlackOption: Without Kindle Unlimited,"It’s infuriating that Amazon went to market with this machine. Do not upgrade from prior Paperwhites.1. To unlock the device, it goes through a long “waking up” period where the backlight is turned up full blast for some reason. It then reverts to your normal backlight setting after unlocking. I blind myself every night reading in bed. All previous Paperwhites unlocked instantly, with no dumb backlight. After you lock it, it will unlock instantly again for a few minutes afterward, so it seems to be “going to sleep” in some deeper way — probably to save battery life.2. It is not significantly lighter, but it is just SLIGHTLY smaller so that it doesn’t fit in the old Paperwhite cases. They obviously did this just to force you to buy a new case. Even worse, there are hardly any cases that fit this design—even from Amazon.3. The battery life is bad, possibly because of the Bluetooth connection. You can turn it off in the settings menu with the WiFi, but it’s disappointing that they only added a feature by making battery life worse AND adding that stupid “waking up” process.Pros:Yes, it’s waterproof—although I mainly go it to stop dog hair being caught in the screen edges. The Bluetooth feature for audible does work, although it’s not better in any way than using your phone.It seems to have more precise control over the backlight brightness... after it wakes up and blinds you.Bottom line: this is not a finished product, and they shoved it out the door because they wanted to have it out for Christmas.",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/R39R7G40FBZG15/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"November 23, 2018",639
Truth Seeker,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEAKDXOQ5BICCT33GPBNOWRSKEBA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,Worst Paperwhite EVER!,1,Verified Purchase,Digital Storage Capacity: 8Offer Type: With Special OffersColor: BlackOption: Without Kindle Unlimited,"After almost 4 years what do we get? Nothing of practical use. Is 8gb of storage really necessary? Of course not, unless you have 10,000 side-loaded books that will take you 20 years to read. Waterproof? After 10 years of owning Kindles I’ve never needed it. So unless you’re Michael Phelps or love to read underwater with goggles on its not necessary. Bluetooth? Does a real book have bluetooth? Worse yet, there is no immersive reading so it’s pointless....Why is this the the worst Paperwhite yet?It feels flimsy and hollow. It still has the same design as the original Paperwhite, you know the one released back in 2012 which makes it 6 years old. It still has the same Dinosaur bezels and now attracts more reflection, smudges and fingerprints than ever before. There is so much glare on this thing my girlfriend uses it to put make-up on. No but seriously a more appropriate name would have been the ""Kindle Refection"" or the ""Kindle Pinhole"" due to going through three different exchanges due to pinholes and dead pixels. It's sad. In my opinion, the previous Paperwhite 3 is better with the paper-like feel of the screen, it also has no glare and much better contrast and clarity. The new Paperwhite suffers from this as well as the dull and uneven lighting as seen in the picture. It also feels cheaply made and you can tell Amazon cut corners in assembly. As an example, the Voyage is also lighter but feels sturdy and solid in the hand whereas the new Paperwhite feels empty. Needless to say this new release is a major disappointment, but thats what happens when Amazon has no competition, the customer is the one to suffer. We all lose. Amazon is not innovating, they are not doing anything to improve the Kindle in practical ways that matter. More storage, waterproof and bluetooth are all gimmicks that the 99.9% of us don’t need. Its all a marketing scam.What would have been nice is page turn buttons, less monstrous bezels, less glare, and Comfort light (the adjustment of color temperature for nighttime reading). Even the Glowlight 3 has it, and it’s 2 year old technology. Side by side this Paperwhite is worst in every way that matters next to my Paperwhite 3. I'm just disgusted with Amazon right now for slacking and making us wait so long for a mediocre device. Lastly, what is up with the White Logo? Talk about distracting! Amazon went black on black with the Paperwhite 3 to avoid distractions and allow for a more immersive reading experience. To go back to a white distracting logo makes absolute no sense. Why Amazon? Here is a side by side picture of the new Paperwhite 4 which should be adequately named (on the left) and the superior Paperwhite 3 (on the right). The choice is clear.",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/R26Q6FYR1SZ2NC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"November 13, 2018","1,366"

First, I bought the Oasis - what a total disappointment!  High price and yet awkward to hold, awkward dimensions, horrendous battery life (mere hours), slow to boot up and lousy cover options.  Back it went.  I wasn't about to shell out a premium price for the exact same (old) Voyage tech and the Paperwhite was too big a downgrade (and ALSO long in tooth), so I held off on choosing a replacement.  I was very disappointed when all they came out with is this new Paperwhite, but I got it anyway.  At this point I'll stick with it, but if I could go back, I'd get a Kobo.This newest Paperwhite is ""meh.""  It's OK.  But it's only OK.  No night mode like the Kobo.  Light, but too small and very cheap feeling.  Case is the same overly expensive price, but feels and looks cheaper than the older Paperwhite cases (Hubby still has his 2nd Gen Paperwhite) - they even omitted the little silver tag on the cover, which jazzed it up a bit.  Like the Oasis, the newest Kindle Paperwhite takes several seconds to turn on - it's bad enough even my husband commented on it when we compared devices.  What on earth are they doing to make these SLOWER than old models?  How do they think people will find this acceptable?  My Surface Pro 4 runs an actual Windows 10 operating system and it boots at least as fast - faster than the Oasis.  Yes, the new Paperwhite is waterproof, but I've never NEEDED waterproofing, so I don't really care.  Backlight is OK but nothing special.  Screen is the same old epaper screen.The new Paperwhite isn't truly bad and it's definitely not great...it's just ""OK"".  It's DEFINITELY preferable to the Oasis.  If you aren't committed to the Amazon ecosystem for books, I'd suggest you check out Kobo or some other ereader brand, instead.  Amazon seems to be really missing the mark with their ereaders these days and it's truly disappointing.",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/REXMB3O4K2P2V/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"November 14, 2018",311

It is a significant update to the Paperwhite, and to summarize the changes made and how significant they are:1. It has a flush front screen for a much more attractive appearance. The Kindle Voyage and Oasis models have had flush screens but this is the first time that a lower-priced Kindle had this feature, and it is a nice improvement2. It’s slightly lighter and thinner than earlier models3. It’s waterproof, making it the second Kindle model (after the latest Oasis) to have that capability. This is a significant improvement.4. It has audio capability – using Bluetooth to connect to headphones or speakers, so you can listen to audiobooks. This is also a significant improvement for those users who enjoy audiobooks – previous Paperwhite models did not have this feature (but the other current Kindles – the Oasis 2 and basic Kindle – do)5. It has greater storage capability – double that of the previous Paperwhite (8 GB now, 4 GB before), with the ability to increase that to 32 GB. This is particularly useful if you have a lot of audiobooks since they use up much more storage spaceWith all of this, the new Paperwhite is only $10 more than the previous version, which makes it an even greater value in my opinion.Amazon’s Kindle line-up is now simplified to three models, and I have all of them so let me give my brief summary:- The ‘basic’ Kindle E-reader has a 6” screen, no lighting, touchscreen controls, and is the lowest cost Kindle for those who don’t need or want a lighted display- The latest Kindle Paperwhite (4th Generation) has a 6” screen, lighted display, touchscreen controls, greater memory and waterproofing. It’s really the best choice for most people, especially with these latest improvements- The top-of-the-line Kindle Oasis (2nd Generation) has the largest display (7”), lighted, touchscreen controls and page turn buttons, greater memory and waterproofing. For those readers who want or need the larger display or the buttons for turning pages, it’s a great e-reader - at almost twice what a Paperwhite costsThe bottom line is that, unless you really want the larger display of the Oasis (and it is nice, although it also makes the device a bit heavier and more bulky to hold), or really want the page turn buttons, then this new Paperwhite really provides everything most people want in their Kindle. Which is why it has been Amazon’s best seller, and I’m sure that this new version will continue the same.I’ve been a Kindle user since purchasing one of the first Paperwhite models in 2012. I spend some time reading every day. When e-readers, including the Kindle, first appeared, I wasn’t interested. I couldn’t imagine that reading with an electronic device would be as satisfying as holding a ‘real’ book in my hands was. Then, when the first lighted Kindle was introduced, I decided to give it a try. These days I find that I seldom buy or read ‘real’ books. It’s so convenient to be able to have a library of books in your hand, and the lighted Kindle is so much nicer for reading in bed than regular books.My favorite Kindles have been my Voyage (largely because the ‘Origami’ case makes it the most convenient to use when reading at a table or desk), and the new Oasis for reading in the evenings in bed. I’m going to give this new Paperwhite a try because I think that the lighter weight will make it even more comfortable to carry and use.",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/R26H76BQPFYZXH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"November 12, 2018",182

Rachel N.,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHXQOVGDI6434YF2BMWQAXLUPQNA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,Great device w/ great features. Battery could use improvement. I miss the bezel and headphone jack.,4,Verified Purchase,Digital Storage Capacity: 8Offer Type: With Special OffersColor: BlackOption: Without Kindle Unlimited,"(Scroll down for a bulleted Pros and Cons list)After having my Kindle Touch for 7 years, I finally upgraded to a Paperwhite! Overall I love it. I will never forget my book light again, the resolution is incredible, it's faster, the new software interface is great, and I love how opening and closing the cover turns the device on and off automatically. And don't forget how amazing E-Ink is and how much easier it is on the eyes than reading on a backlit tablet. However, there are a few things I miss, like the raised bezel, the 3.5 mm headphone jack, and the better battery life my old Kindle had.When reading in a room with low lighting, the built-in light provides an excellent enhancement, however the light is not so great in a completely dark room. While I love that it goes to a very low level, it has a blueish LED light, which means it's hard to focus on the text, and its blue light that can keep you up at night. Seeing as my Fire tablet was the first device I ever had with a built in blue light blocker, I was surprised that Amazon didn't put more yellowish LEDs into their Paperwhite.The screen on this is wonderful. The resolution is so high that the text is crisper than it could ever be on a printed page, and I have always loved Kindle's easy ability to change the font-size to larger print as needed. I have a love-hate relationship with the solid glass(?) screen. It looks sleek, having the entire front of the device at a single level, but the black bezel area shows fingerprints like mad, and the lack of a raised bevel leaves the screen more prone to chips and cracks, as well as to accidental page-turns if you hold onto the bezel.Only two days after receiving my new Paperwhite, I had left the  case open and set the device on the sofa, while I went to get a glass of water. When I returned, I sat down next to it and then had to tend to my toddler on the other side of me, and I knocked the Kindle onto the floor. It landed face-down, and now there's a chip in the screen. Thankfully, that chip is only in the bezel area, but really, a chip in my two-day-old device from falling only 1 foot?!I will probably never use Audible on my Paperwhite. That's for two reasons. The first reason is the lack of a 3.5 mm headphone jack (I own zero Bluetooth headphones or speakers), and the second reason is the lack of immersive reading, where you can have the Audible book read along to the eBook text. I'll just use Audible on my phone or Fire tablet where I have both of these features. Here's hoping Amazon releases the immersive reading feature to the Paperwhite in the near future.The battery life... has issues. Initially, when I first unboxed my Paperwhite, it ate through the battery. However, it was downloading my entire eBook library, I was flicking through lots of menus, and it was downloading a software update in the background. I burned through half my battery that first day.After the software updated, the next day, battery life was a bit better. The new software changed it so that the Kindle goes into standby when not in use, and that helps it use less battery.However, it was still draining faster than my old Kindle Touch battery did. To remedy that, I usually keep my Paperwhite in airplane mode, only turning on wifi at the end of each reading session to sync up my reading progress, and then turning it back off. Doing this has made it so that I only use about 5% of my battery for each half hour of reading. Thankfully, the battery does charge up much faster than my old Kindle Touch did, but it does make me wonder about the longevity of this battery's capacity as my device ages.Overall, I like the Paperwhite more than my Touch, even though I have a few complaints. I could go into even more details, but seeing as I've already written quite a bit, I figured I'd just leave you with a giant list of Pros and Cons. Also, if I could have rated the Paperwhite with 4.5 stars, I would have.Pros: • Screen:  ○ High contrast - seems whiter than my old Kindle Touch  ○ Amazing resolution, can't see any pixilation, crisper than print on a page  ○ Capacitive touch screen means no more accidentally turning the page with my sleeve  ○ Can see great in bright light or low light (with the screen light on) • Light:  ○ Nice enhancement in low-lighting  ○ No more forgetting the book light  ○ No glare from a book light shining on the screen  ○ Light level goes very low - I can read in the dark without it being too bright, and it doesn't keep up my baby or husband • Updated software interface  ○ So many settings, especially for the reading text (font, size, typeface, line spacing, margins, orientation)  ○ Peek ahead options, to look at previous or upcoming pages without changing your position (or reading progress) in the book, or even to quickly look through and navigate to another page.  ○ The ability to only have some of my collections from the cloud appear on my device.  ○ Integration with Goodreads  - I can easily share my progress and remarks on the book I'm reading, easily add books to my Goodreads shelf, and easily see my Goodreads lists. • Faster and more responsive than my old Kindle Touch • Waterproof - now I'm not afraid to read in the bath! • Magnetic cover  ○ Automatically wakes on open, and puts the Kindle to sleep on close • More storage  ○ I never ran out of space on my old Kindle, but now I have even more! • Lighter, thinner, and that cool feeling, almost ""fuzzy"" hard plastic covers the entire back of the deviceCons: • Screen:  ○ ""Non-reflective"" is still semi-reflective, like a high-gloss magazine (same as other Kindle reader screens)  ○ Shows fingerprints - no big deal on reading area, but ugly on bezel  ○ Solid glass with no bezel means more chances of chips and cracks  ○ Capacitive touch screen  - I can't turn the page with gloves on, or through a blanket  - When the device is wet, water can cause it to register fake taps - use the ""disable touchscreen"" option in the menu, and then it only detects swipes • Light:  ○ Has a lot of blue spectrum in it  ○ Feels more like a backlight, when used in total darkness  ○ LED light makes it hard to focus without any ambient light, so I have to make the font larger when reading in a dark room • Battery life:  ○ Drains fairly quickly when wifi is left on  ○ When wifi is off, still drains faster than my old Kindle Touch's battery, but is much, much better and might last a week or two, depending upon how much you read and what level you use the light at • Power button position  ○ It's easy to accidentally turn the Kindle off while reading, if you hold it by the bottom • Software interface:  ○ I can't figure out how to share to Facebook when I've completed a book. I used to do this with every book on my old Kindle Touch. • No more 3.5mm headphone jack or built in speakers (my old Kindle Touch had these and I loved both)  ○ I will never use Audible on my Paperwhite because of this. I will instead use it on my phone. • No immersive reading where you can let your Audible book narrate along the page of your eBook  ○ It's either read the eBook text, or listen to the Audible book; you can't do both at once  ○ I hope they update the software to support this, like tablets do",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/ROOFXU9D2LJM7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"November 19, 2018",123

Amazon did follow up afterwards which I appreciate the original unit ended up being sent to their engineering department, which suggests a concern with quality control. And my new unit is wonderful. It is replacing a 2014 paperwhite. I really wanted and like the water resistant  aspect. It’s nice to read in the bathtub without a ziplock bag or a worry about an accident. I also like the extra memory and being able to Bluetooth connect to headphones. Once you have downloaded an audible book to go with a kindle version, you can’t delete the audible without also deleting the kindle (and then redownloading the latterif you want), at least as far as I have been able to figure out.  It feels lighter than my old one (which may be a difference in cases — I ordered the water-resistant fabric one of from Amazon and my old one had a leather case). The front is completely flush — no bevel down to the screen, so it feels more like a paper book in that way. I find the unit to be very responsive except for menu items — then it is slow to recognize the tap and if I tap again I end up getting two or three menus appearing over one another when they do show up. Other than that, all the wonderful aspects of the old paperwhite + the new features.",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/R3JQLJH8P7Y9SX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"November 12, 2018",113

The flat edge to edge screen is an improvement in feel and makes it much easier to clean. It still has an excellent non-glare screen that I love for reading outdoors.Mine is the 32G model, which is absolutely the best improvement for me, as my ebook library had outgrown my old Kindle's capacity, forcing me to remove parts of my library from it. It is a personal quirk, but I prefer to have my entire library available to me on my device.I'm also very pleased by the addition of Audible capability, allowing me to combine my libraries into one device. Mine paired easily with my Yurbuds Bluetooth earbuds, allowing for comfortable listening.As with my last Kindle, my reading experience is unbelievably enhanced. My eyesight is poor and reading small print triggers migraines. As I am able to choose a font and print size that works for me, the Kindle has meant that I can read as much as I like again.The only fly in the ointment, and this does not change my love for this new generation Kindle, is that my wonderful, well made cover for last generation will not fit the new one, and the design and quality of the new covers just doesn't stand up to the old one.",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/R1A9YL4P7X5GXK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"November 12, 2018",88
don't you wish you knew,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHXDAPFBGFWTQTKLTBMCMCKIL6FA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,We're Started With Three-stars & Now at Two-stars,2,Verified Purchase,Digital Storage Capacity: 8Offer Type: With Special OffersColor: BlackOption: Without Kindle Unlimited,"11/27/18: I think I'm finished with this Paperwhite. I can't even say ""good effort"" on Amazon's part because it isn't. My problems are these: I have older eyes and the light doesn't go as bright as I need it, nor as bright as my previous gen. The power button is a disaster, sticking out the way it does. My previous gen doesn't have that issue either. The touch isn't responsive and doesn't function as well as my older PW. The text is fuzzy and not crisp, and when add in the poor color cast it needs to go back. The best I can say for this new PW is that it has very even lighting with no led shadowing, but that's not enough for me. I'm calling it quits and getting a refund. Life is too short to pay for devices you don't love.Clarification: The Verified Purchase info indicates I bought an 8gb with special offers. I did not. I actually bought and paid for the 32gb without special offers model. I checked how many gigs I have and there are zero special offers.Conclusion: If you have a good, working Paperwhite, keep it. This is no real improvement unless you need waterproof and audible on the device. If yours is getting dicey, might be a good time for an upgrade. I don’t care about using it near or in the water and I’m unlikely to listen to Audible books on it. For me it’s just another Paperwhite with less bright lighting and a bad temperature cast. If I change my mind later I will update my review. I intend to do a bit more testing before I exchange it. I hope to get one with better lighting or I'm done.Edit: This solved part of my unintentional button pressing. These felt dots on this tablet holder that I use for my new Paperwhite, and previous gens, kept the button out of harms way when placing/removing, adjusting the position, etc. I put one felt dot at each end of the tray, just slightly in from the end edges, perhaps 1/4"". I have also used thin foam strips in the past but I'm out of them.Stand:https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004W697ES/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1Felt Dots:https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VYN7CS/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1Please see the additions to my review under ""Not fond of"".What I like:For those who need accessibility options, VoiceView and Invert Black and White are great. I’m not there yet, but I’m glad they’re there.The flush screen with only a bit of a bezel is lovely and while there is a bit of glare, it’s not horrible where I normally read. The glass of the screen is not cold like the Voyage was. I sent that one back because it was too cold to hold. I also avoided the Oasis for that reason. In fact, this screen is warmer to touch than my current Paperwhite which is the 3rd gen of the Paperwhites.Connecting to Wi-Fi and Bluetooth was flawless. And I love that the logo is barely there now instead of the much brighter silver logo on mine. It's a faint white now and almost, but not quite, invisible while reading.The lighting, though subpar compared to my Paperwhite, is perfect in terms of shadowing, etc. Unlike my Paperwhite, you cannot see the LEDs or their shadows at all. The design team nailed this one. Well done, but what happened with the rest? The improvements aren't improvements and some are actually intrusive and backwards.Not fond of:Update: 11/15/18The power button is obnoxious. Too prominent and too easy to press, which leads you to three choices. Cancel doesn't work and turns the screen off, it should just make the options go away.. Screen off also turns it off. Restart does what it says. So dumb, It was better when it was configured to either turn the screen off if pressed once and hold to restart. Changed isn't always better programmers! Please learn not to break what doesn't need fixing.The very slow starting screen is equally tiresome, and battery life? There is no battery life. Terrible changes to a previously flawless device configuration. Why muck up a great device that had a great screen in favor of a subpar device with terrible lighting and temperature cast.Previous Not fond of:Everything is pretty much the same. The screen lighting has the same issues that the one I bought in August had. Cannot believe they didn't even bother to expand or change up the screen savers. They could have added to them or changed them or something, but no. Wow. Just wow.Lighting: The temperature of the light is unacceptable. It’s decidedly darker and grayer than the same setting on my current Paperwhite. On the highest setting it is noticeably yellow whereas my Paperwhite is a lovely, clean white with zero blue or gray cast.Fonts: Seriously? Only one new font after four years since I bought mine? It’s like the design team went to sleep four years ago and never woke up.Fingerprint magnet: I’m going to use a bit of baby powder before handling to remove natural oils, if I remember to do that. I prefer the texture of my previous gen Paperwhite. It’s a better tactile sensation, but definitely colder as I mentioned. The touch of this new one isn’t terribly responsive. Perhaps this first batch is a bit buggy.Packing/Shipping: The shipping packaging was terrible and UPS’s handling was no better. This is a tiny device in a barely-there, thin, paper-box put into a too-large box with zero protection around it, no bubbles, and no paper to protect it during shipping. It was literally bouncing around inside the box, as UPS bounced it around, until it reached my home where it was literally tossed onto the porch. I wasn’t confident it would work at all, but it does.

Our first Kindle had a real keyboard, solid with clicky buttons. It also had a charger, a speaker, a headphone jack, and the ability to play music and audiobooks. The latest Kindle Paperwhite has none of these. It has a backlight!Don't mistake me, a backlight is a great thing to have on an e-reader. Its one of the several reasons I purchased this new Kindle, but I also bought it for the extra memory to accommodate promised audiobooks, only to find no clue to them in the start-up feature walk- through. There was no more than a single slip of paper included with Kindle and that directed me to the user's guide that Amazon graciously offered to lend for a while (or sell me for $11). That manual too had no mention of how to load and play music or drama files.Accessing customer support led to much waiting, and several hang-ups between brief chat sessions with a rotating series of Audible (yes, Audible, not Amazon) support staff. Finally, the truth came through: yes, from now on, when using the Kindle, ""audio"" means ""Audible"". Got years worth of audiobooks? Sorry, you need to buy new ""Audible"" books! Downloaded ten new albums from Amazon? Sorry, not permitted on Kindle!O.K., yes I'm also biased. I purchased a test Audible membership some time back, I found the audio quality to be so bad that I completed and closed my membership as quickly as possible.  But now it seems that the once great e-reader -slash- good-enough audio player is settling down to be a proprietary  audio book player with space for books when available.

When I first opened it I could tell it seemed longer, and maybe the wider bezel around it is for readers who prefer to read without a case, offering a better grip. Just guessing. I have both the Oasis, (both versions), and the Voyage, (a couple of them gifts and wonderful ereaders, I’ve thought), and I have loved them and still do, so I wasn’t expecting to really be impressed with this new ereader. I like to have an extra ereader or two so when my friends come to visit, we can all sit around and read if we want when we’re tired of going.So a great surprise to see what a terrific ereader this is. Very lightweight , great flush screen, good adjustable back lighting, and just an easy tap to turn pages, and not even having to move your hand. Also there’s a good variety of cases to purchase and protect it. I prefer reading with a case on for a better grip for my smallish hands who are now home to some arthritis. I was able to find a great inexpensive case that fit well and has the sleep wake function. And now I see this as a wonderful option as a travel ereader too.  It’s very thin, light, and compact, even in a case. I’ve had Amazon ereader’s since 2011, and have been impressed with most of them. But this one really impressed me since I haven’t had a Paperwhite version for awhile. Really with this version there’s not a lot of reason to upgrade to the Oasis. (Though I have to admit I love reading on my Oasis). But this is an easy to hold, very easy to see, easy to turn pages without moving your hand reader with great storage and, the opportunity of audible. What is not to love about it. Also the flush screen is a perfect upgrade. I read in bed the other night and the on/off button that another reviewer mentioned positioned at the bottom thought because of the placement , might turn the screen off, didn’t come into play at all, and then when the case came and I read in it again it seemed with the case there was no issue. It seems all Amazon has learned about producing ereaders came together with this 2018 Paperwhite. Really for me this is a five star product.",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/R25947LBEAK8QD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"November 12, 2018",52
Naima Dillard Thomas,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEZDSJDXNPSYRM6HXNKJQ7HORZTQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,The battery sucks. *Update 02-13-2019,2,Verified Purchase,Digital Storage Capacity: 32Offer Type: Without Special OffersColor: BlackOption: Without Kindle Unlimited,"I was so excited to find out there was a new paperwhite with bluetooth capabilities for audible. I'm a serious reader and my job doesn't make way for me to actually ""read"" a book, so Audible allows me to work and get my book fix at the same time. That's the only reason why I bought this; my old paperwhite works just fine and the battery lasts forever!Well, the new paperwhite is nice, it's a little lighter, but the old generation never bothered me in terms of weight and handiness. I like the extra storage and I especially like the audible feature. The reason why I'm giving this product 3 stars is the deplorable battery life. I charged it fully this morning (7:00am) and its halfway gone by 3:30pm. Not cool. Perhaps it's the new features, but Amazom advertises this Kindle as having just as much of a long battery life as its previous makes. I would have never purchased this if I knew the battery sucked; I would just listen using my phone. Too bad for me, I gave my old paperwhite away to a friend. Ironically, I was going to buy the oasis but stopped when so many customers complained that the battery was inferior, now I feel slightly cheated.*update February 13, 2019:I really wish I hadn't bought this device and just kept my old one. I originally purchased it for the Audible features but I don't use it; I'm too annoyed at the device disconnecting from my earphones if I leave the device paused. Honestly, of I'm at work and I pause Audible, within a minute my Kindle will disconnect from my earphones and I'll have to connect them. Annoying, especially considering my iPad or Android phone has never done this--i can paused something, walk way, come back and click ""play"" on my earphones and the book will resume. Not with this over priced ebook reader. It disconnects, so I'm forced to flip open the case, then I have to wait for it go through ""waking up."" Again, annoying. I purchased this for Audible; had I known this device was so inferior I would of kept my old paperwhite and continued to use the app with my phone. Honestly, my old paperwhite was my favorite piece of tech. To me, it was Amazon's perfect ebook reader. Sometimes simple is better.It's sad because I dont really use this at all; when I'm at home and I can actually look at a book, I read from my phone or a physical copy because the screen is not like the original. The light isn't as soft as the old one.I don't want to be wasteful, so I'm slowly but surely using it--I'm forcing myself to put it in my purse and read it during my lunch break or on my commute. Let's be honest, I'm probably just going to give this to my mother-in-law and buy the older one again--but I kind of like my mother-in-law so that might my cruel to give her a device that's not worth the money I spent on it.Any pros? Its light, really unnoticeable in my purse or my hand. I'm a fan of the size and how flat and matte the screen feels. I can't speak personally on the storage because I haven't maxed it out, nor have I even maxed out the old one despite how many books I buy. I like the case, it's easy to remove so I can clean the device, yet it does a good job of protecting the paperwhite. I purchased the Amazon case so it was expensive, but at the time smaller companies hadn't come out with any knockoffs, so I'm sure there are better alternatives.Unfortunately, I have to knock a star off of my original review. When I first reviewed this, I only had the device for a few short weeks. Now, after owning it for some time I feel better about my decision on giving it such a low rating. I used to be a ""book snob,"" look down my nose at electric devices. I blamed them for the reason Borders went out of business among other things. Then my physical library got too big and being a person that reads more than one book at a time, my purse started getting heavier. Then my grandmother bought me a cheap I-can't-remember-the-brand-name-to-save-my-life ebook reader and I loved it. So when that device died, I took the plunge and bought a paperwhite. And kept it for YEARS. I'm not even joking; the paperwhite I gave to my friend, I had for years. I had it for so long the case I originally bought for it just fell off one day. It was a composition style case and by the time it made it to the trash it turned into a gray case.So, I wrote all that just to say, this is really disappointing Amazon. I know ebook readers are on the bottom of the totem pole when it comes to tech, but you had a product that performed greatly for what it was and for it's price. And I'm sure you had the money and the expertise to make this model even better, but you missed the mark for some reason. Shame.",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/R3MJ5BM7HW51TR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"November 12, 2018",48
Birgey,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGIYV2LANB7KGCCDMFBVBO6QTUNA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,Nice upgrade from the previous model!,5,Verified Purchase,Digital Storage Capacity: 8Offer Type: With Special OffersColor: BlackOption: Without Kindle Unlimited,"The new Paperwhite to me is the best bang for your buck in terms of an e-reader. It’s essentially the same as the previous Paperwhite, with a few new upgrades. The biggest and nicest change is the flush screen. That was the biggest selling point to me. In the previous Paperwhite, the screen kind of dipped into the device, thus every so often you’d get debris and what not in the sides of the screen. So you had to clean it off every so often. With the flush screen, it’s smooth like an iPad screen, surface wise. You still got the same screen quality as the other Paperwhites though.The device is also water proof, which I guess that’s cool. But I don’t ever see myself being in a situation where I’m like “gotta get my kindle wet.” But I guess that’s a perk for people who like to read while in a pool, bathtub, or hot tub.There’s also new themes you can do that change the “theme” of your screen while you read. I haven’t messed around too much with that but seems like a cool new addition.It’s also lighter and a tad thinner than the previous Paperwhite model. So, that’s a plus.The photos I’ve added are of the device, and the black cloth fabric.If you’re looking for a nice e reader, that isn’t too pricey, has a nice flush screen, with some cool perks like it being water resistant, I suggest this one. It does the same stuff as the Oasis and Voyage which are more expensive.

And of course its not running the current software, its running the 5.10.0.1.To introduce major hardware upgrades and not the latest software, and then expect customers to wait upwards of a month for a corresponding software update??? Why would Amazon think that is acceptable??Anyway, both 10th generations are going back as soon as possible.

After spending hours on the phone with 3 different CS reps, I now understand the current 5.10.1.2 software is not available to download, anywhere. No active Kindle content, no custom fonts, no scrolling home page, etc.Amazon has agreed to send me another new 10th generation at no charge to make up for this little snafu however, I am not convinced the new 'new' device will have the current 5.10.1.2 software on it.The last CS rep actually said she didn't understand what the problem was since the device still worked and downloaded books and I could buy and read on it. I had to explain to her that the software is what allows one to personalize the device and its this personalization that keeps Kindle owners coming back again and again. the IPX rating, the flush screen, the bluetooth / Audible features are great to have, but its the software that can make it yours.And speaking of bluetooth, is it not time to re-introduce device music playback?

Josh,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHB7KZGSOFMHLVS7RQMGCGFCAY5A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,Best Kindle ever… Waterproof tested!,5,Verified Purchase,Digital Storage Capacity: 8Offer Type: With Special OffersColor: BlackOption: Without Kindle Unlimited,"Quick summary in case you don’t want to read my whole review: This is the best Kindle ever. If you are searching for a great reading device then this is the one you want!I’ve had many Kindles over the years, beginning with the very first one with the full keyboard and the strange looking scroll wheel with LCD indicator. At the time that first Kindle was amazing even though it is a dinosaur by today’s standards.From there I moved on to the subsequent smaller models without the keyboard, the original Paperwhite with the built in lighting, the fancy new Oasis last year, and finally to my current Kindle which is the most recent Paperwhite prior to this new release.Last year I wrote in my review of the Oasis (which you can view here: https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1X98VSOJ61Z4C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B075M8FDWM) that despite the Oasis being a great, premium device, I still recommend just buying the Paperwhite. Despite the Paperwhite not being waterproof like the Oasis, having a different (smaller) screen size with less LEDs for lighting, and not having the “premium” device feel with the metal case I still preferred the Paperwhite due to it’s comparably low cost and I actually liked the feel of the case better when reading. Ultimately I returned the Oasis and purchased the Paperwhite. For my money the only thing that was really missing on the Paperwhite compared to the Oasis was the waterproofing.And now… (drumroll….) the Paperwhite has waterproofing!For me just knowing this one new feature (the waterproofing) is enough to know that this is the best Kindle yet because I already put the previous Paperwhite in that top position.For good measure I had to immediately test the waterproof feature. Be sure to see my pictures, since seeing is believing! First I just simulated spilling a glass of water on it. That was easy to clean up with just a few swipes of a paper towel. Then I actually submerged the entire device in a bowl of water. It continued to work fine even while underwater and when I removed it the paper towel wiped it dry without any issues. The only residual water were some drips from the charging port on the bottom (the only port on the new Kindle Paperwhite). I gave the unit a few good shakes and the remaining water came out of the port (shaking produced a surprising amount of water!). Test passed!The other new things are kind of a bonus to me, the main ones being:- 8 GB of storage on the base model. This now matches the Oasis base storage. I really don’t think you need a lot of storage on a Kindle unless you will be away from Wi-Fi for long periods of time and need to be able to carry tons of books on the device, but having extra space can’t hurt. - Flush front screen. It’s nice that the screen and the bezel around the screen are now flush so you can easily wipe things off the screen without them potentially getting stuck along the edges. Previous models had the screen sunken below the bezels so it was always possible that something could get stuck under the bezel. This flush design just makes it easier to clean without worrying about those edges. - Audible. This may be a big deal to you if you use Audible a lot. You can now listen to your Audible books via Bluetooth headphones or speakers. For some reason I feel like I would just use my phone if I wanted to listen to Audible, but if you’d rather use the Kindle it’s now an option with the Paperwhite for the first time. Other Kindle models have had it for years and now it’s finally available on the Paperwhite.In the past I always criticized the Paperwhite models for having uneven lighting. I am happy to report that the lighting on this new model is much improved and seems to be very even now! Despite still only using 5 LEDs versus the Kindle Oasis’ 12 LED setup I think it would actually be hard to tell the difference between the two. Previously I could see lots of “hot” and “cold” spots on the Paperwhite screens where the lighting was uneven. I am not noticing that nearly as much now, if at all! So even though the Oasis has a technically better lighting setup I think most people will find that the new Paperwhite screen is perfectly fine for low light reading (see picture).As I said in the beginning, I had already recommended the last generation Paperwhite over the Oasis even without the waterproofing, larger storage, or Audible support. Now that the Paperwhite has all of those things and a seemingly improved lighting system it’s an even better buy! The Paperwhite is just shy of half the price of the Oasis as of this review making it an incredible value!If you already have the most recent Paperwhite then there’s not a huge difference and upgrading may not be worth it to you. The main things you’ll get are the waterproofing and the Audible support. I upgraded mine mainly to get the waterproofing. Using Amazon to trade in my old Paperwhite I was able to buy the new one for around half price (they pay you for the old device AND give you a coupon for a discount on the new one). For me it was worth it, but of course you’ll have to decide for yourself if the new features are worth the cost of upgrading.If you don’t have a Paperwhite already then it’s a no-brainer and this new one is the model to get.Pros:- Waterproof! Now you can read by the pool, on the beach, or in the tub without fear of destroying your device.- Lighting system seems to be improved and provides a more even light pattern compared to previous Paperwhite models.- Flush screen makes cleaning smudges or dirt easier.- Audible support means you can listen to your books via Bluetooth.- Double the base storage of the previous model, now matches the Oasis with 8 GB to start.- Great Kindle interface just like all the models. There’s really no need to review this as it’s basically the same as it has been and works great for what it’s purpose is.- Thin and light, easy to hold while reading with a nice texture that doesn’t feel like it will fall out of your hand.Cons:- None! Unless you count the plastic case as one versus the Oasis metal case (I don’t since I like the feel of the Paperwhite’s rubberized back better)… or if you think 12 LED lights on the Oasis are better than 5 on the Paperwhite, but again the Paperwhite’s lighting is much improved and provides a very nice, even light.The bottom line here is that this is by far the best Kindle device for the money. It’s worth the extra price compared to the base Kindle just because it gets you the lighting (which to me is a requirement for reading in bed or reading on the plane) and now it gets you waterproofing. The jump up to the Oasis really is even less justified now as the Oasis just gets you a metal case, a marginally better screen size/aspect ratio, and MAYBE better lighting… for almost twice the price.Buy this one. There’s no reason to look at the other models.TIP: If you happen to already have a sleeve-type case for your previous Paperwhite then the case will most likely also fit the new Paperwhite. I’ve been using this case for about a year and it fits the new model great as well: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073GFS4K8/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/R8NAVGT5UHJEU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"November 12, 2018",39

We read every single night for a good hour together and listen to a massive amount of Audible books.So far everything has been very underwhelming. Actually... super underwhelming.1. Very minimal packaging - Good in that it uses very little resources but bad when compared to what your used to getting with today's gadgets.  ps. It still came in a box that could fit a good 10 Kindle Paper Whites.2. Instantaneous first impression from myself, wife, and 8 year old daughter was how small it was. To the point of too small.  Expected a larger screen or better screen to body ratio which leads to the next point.3. Crazy large bezels!!!  I mean ridiculously large.  This is very similar to the original 2012 Nexus 7 Android Tablet.  That's 7 year old design language. Are you kidding?!?!?!4. Still using Micro USB. My phone that came out over two years ago has USB C and most of our new gadgets bought since then are USB C.  Again we seem to be going backwards in time here.5.  No night mode.  The first thing I did when I layed down to read was to try and invert the colors.  I couldn't believe this was not a feature of the most popular mainstream ebook reader.6.  Worst of all and what brought me to writing a review within the first few hours after opening the box is the Kindle ecosystem.  What a discombobulated disaster!!!  I spent hours hunting through different apps on my smartphone and on the paperwhite trying to get a few books for the kids.  Within the first hour I had 3 apps for getting books.  The first book I went to get from the app store said free with Kindle Unlimited so I signed up for the free trial to check it out.  I then went to search for more books that are part of Kindle Unlimited and soon found out how cumbersome that is to do.  There is no Kindle Unlimited browsing mode in the Amazon app on my smartphone so no way to easily look through what's available.  I then tried doing different types of searches in the app using kindle unlimited in the search terms but that was becoming cumbersome and not yielding good results.  I then Googled how to browse Kindle Unlimited books.  Instructions said that you could when using the Kindle app.  So I then install the Kindle app so that I could better browse the Unlimited selection.  I soon hit another brick wall when there was hardly anything to browse in the Kindle Unlimited section of the Kindle app and there is no search specific to Kindle Unlimited.  After getting super frustrated with the poor ecosystem I took a break for an hour.  After that I started searching for more books and came upon Howl's Moving Castle.  There I noticed it said $0 with freeTimeunlimited.  So, another subscription service that another set of books are a part of...I guess I'll sign up and see what it's about.  I then go through the process of setting up my daughter's account but Howl's Moving Castle did not show up on her FreeTimeunlimited.  I then tried to get the book in the Amazon app on my phone and it takes to to install a new FreeTimeunlimited app...a third app!! I decided to go back to the Kindle and try again.  I exited the FreetimeUnlimited mode and went to the book again and clicked the read for free.  It then launches freeTimeUnlimted but the book is not there.  Another fail!  I then try to use the search and nothing shows up in the search with the freetimeunlimited.  Failed again.  After that I uninstalled everything off my phone and cancelled the two subscriptions I had just signed up for and decided I'll just by the books outright.  What a messy ecosystem that doesn't even work properly when you spend the time wading through the muck.I'm just about to the point of returning this thing.  I'll give it a couple more days and see how it goes but I think it's already at my limit of bad design choices and ecosystem failures.",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/R2SHPB2UQXDC71/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"November 20, 2018",38

Contacted customer support for a replacement, as obviously the battery wasn't charging properly.  Only had to go through three reps to get the return label...a personal achievement!Notified the replacement had not been delivered (at a time my wife and I were both home) by the USPS. Reported it to them and Amazon.  After four reps, got a replacement sent.  It arrives with the one that was ""undeliverable"".  Charged both.  Batteries seem to be OK.  Getting ready to contact Amazon to return one of them.  Screen locks up.  Software was not the latest version that was on my wife's (working) new Kindle.  Tried the other one.  Same; screen locks up when downloading a book, not the latest software.  Both had to be force rebooted to unfreeze.  Both locked up again.  Again, had to force reboot to unfreeze.Tired of having my life sucked out by defective products, contacted support to return two, and *maybe* try again.  After going through eight reps, my patience was at an end, and went for the return and refund.  This was the most unhelpful customer support I have ever experienced from Amazon.I do not recommend purchasing the new Paperwhite Kindles until they work the bugs out, if at all.  My older reader seems like it will have to do for the foreseeable future.Edited to add: Had to return my wife's new Kindle paperwhite.  Would not stay connected to the WiFi.  Would not allow books to be shared from our family library.  (Books showed up fine on her old Kindle, her phone, and her computer - just not the new one.)  She's now stuck with her older Kindle.All in all, a pretty unpleasant experience, Amazon.  Now I'm waiting with bated (thanks Kaila - pokking autocorrect) breath to see how the refund process and credit for two older Kindles traded in for the new ones will go.  (I'm guessing not well.)2nd Edit - finally got the refund after going back and forth; seems they couldn't figure out their own order number system.

It's probably a good thing because it gave me a little more time with it.  That being said, I'm not that crazy about it after all and I would still be using my kindle paperwhite (previous generation) if the charging port didn't stop working (coincidentally) the day this was announced, (go figure). That's the first thing to go on all Amazon devices whether it's a Kindle Fire HD or Reader. Amazon needs to check themselves.For the New Kindle Paperwhite the SCREEN looks more like a tablet than a book.  I thought the whole purpose of the Paperwhite was that it looked like the pages of a book. Soft and creamy as in my picture.  The picture on the left is the NEW PW and on the right is the OLD PW (same degree). Even though the Old PW is creamy it's much easier to read and brighter in it's own right.  The New PW now has that blue light we were trying to get away from, so it's harder on the eyes and you will spend less time reading from it. It defeats the purpose. (If it ain't broke don't fix it). Hope you can see the difference in the pictures.  Also the battery life is not as long as other generations. I love Amazon devices and I have all of them.  Not loving this one yet but I guess I don't  have a choice but to get used to it. I hope I do. The size is exactly the same but flatter so it doesn't fit your old case. It's ever so slightly loose. What's that about?  It is waterproof though that was never my concern.  The screen is completely flat with no ridge (hence the waterproofing). I do still like it because it is a Paperwhite.  I just don't love it...yet?  Oh, you also have an extra step when you want to change the font. It's now a drop down menu.

I did have a problem getting the Kindle to properly detect Library changes or receive samples, but after talking with someone at Amazon, we were able to resolve the problem by de-registering and re-registering the Paperwhite to get it working properly.I would really like to see better contrast on the black to white scale, and hope that Amazon is still trying to bring about color e-ink in the future.In short, this latest generation of the Paperwhite is a good device if you don't have an earlier generation of the device, but I would recommend waiting a little longer if you have an earlier generation and are looking for something much better for the cost of getting something new.",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/RL373ZKWVIOD7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"December 2, 2018",26

You can’t even browse the Kindle or Audible stores while continuing to listen to your book.

Text is crispy and clear in all lighting settings and while using inverted black & white text. The screen is very prone to fingerprints, but luckily they are not noticeable while reading. I don’t notice any difference in lighting from the previous Paperwhite. There is no adaptive light or night mode.Look & feel:The 10th Gen Paperwhite is noticeable lighter and a bit smaller than its predecessor. The back is a matte finish which makes it feel comfortable to hold; however, it’s a fingerprint magnet.Waterproof:We finally have a waterproof Paperwhite! Ran it under water with zero issues.Firmware:My Paperwhite shipped with Kindle Firmware Version 5.10.1.1. I received an OTA Firmware update to 5.10.1.2. This is a great update that added some noticeable, helpful features to the Paperwhite (Note: This update is also available for the previous Paperwhite)1)  Create personal  “Themes” which saves the page layout, font and font size.2)  Return library books from your Kindle by long pressing in the cover and selecting return3)  Remaining battery percentage is shown next to the battery symbol.4)  Toolbar labelsAudible:The ability to access my Audible library and the Audible store is a huge plus. You can quickly switch between the Kindle version to Audible by clicking the headphone icon in the button corner. This will automatically turn on Bluetooth & bring you to the Audible book. If you decide you want to go back to reading simply click on the book icon. Note: Bluetooth will remain on until manually turn it off. While listening to an Audible book you can adjust the volume/speed, jump fwd/backward 30 secs, add bookmarks and view/go to chapters. One thing missing that I’d love is a sleep timer.  Immersion reading would also be a nice feature.New Accessibility Features for Paperwhite include:VoiceView which will read your Kindle book to you using (You will need to connect to a Bluetooth speaker)Invert black and white. I love this feature when reading in complete darkness. So much easier on my eyes.Battery:I was a bit concerned the battery performance would be on par with the entry level Kindle that also has Audible & Voice View. I’m happy to say the battery performance on the 10th gen Paperwhite is much better. I’ve read Kindle books for about 12 hours w/light at 50%, listened to Audible for approx 3 hours, played around with settings for maybe 30 minutes, connected to WiFi 24/7 and an OTA update was completed. My battery is currently at 42%.I opted for the 8GB with Special Offers as 8GB will be plenty for my use as keep my Kindle/Audible content in the cloud and only download the books I’m currently reading or listening to. The special offers don’t interfere with reading and I’ve actually found new authors to love with the recommendations.So far I’m loving my Waterproof Paperwhite.

I never realized that my hands moved so much when I read my Kindle, but I was constantly causing Kindle to page forward and backward which drove me crazy! I could find no setting to freeze or shut down this constant movement in my former Kindle. This new Paperwhite has a new setting that allows you to ""Disable the Touchscreen"" which is the solution to correct the constant jumping pages... However, you have change this setting every time to start to read!  Also, it takes a long time to turn or start this new Kindle.  The swipe to start takes much longer then my older Kindle! Would I still buy this Kindle over a regular Kindle? Absolutely!  Am I thrilled with the new improvements, NO!  This is my initial review... So what's so much better about this paperwhite? First, it's not as sensitive as my last one! I spent more time going backwards then forward!  No matter how I set my ""Settings""  it was just too touchy and too sensitive! This paperwhite with about 25 hours of reading time so far, works like a dream!  If this your FIRST Kindle...Please make note: I get approximately 12 hours from 1 charge on my Paperwite!! NOT WEEKS!

This is about ¼ less the memory promised for this new kindle edition. I called amazon and talk to a kindle supervisor names Calvin who told me to reset the device to manufacturing settings and this should fix the issue. After doing so it still read 6.23gbs.I don’t know what is considered a big story, but I personally thought that this was. I checked the internet for other complains, I searched “incorrect memory” and “memory problem” for the 2018 kindle paperwhite and didn’t find any similar issues. I know when it comes to tech devices that hold memory it is common for a device to be marginally more or less of flash or solid state memory. This however is off by ¼ which is HUGEE. Amazon markets this device as “All-new Kindle Paperwhite – Now Waterproof with 2x the Storage – Includes Special Offers”.**Update**As soon as I posted my review Amazon called me and clarified that infact the firmware/OS does take up 1.5Gbs+. I feel a certain way way about this... I don't understand how you can advertise 2x the memory compared to the 2017 model. Its not like we're talking about a computer or phone with the OS consuming a few Gbs. This is a 8Gb device  which had 1/4 the memory take by OS.How about Amazon makes the device 9.5Gbs and then sells it as 2x the memory compared to 2017 Kindle model.... hmmm? or clarify under technical details:Memory  > 8Gb**This includes the Firmware/OS memory and actually memory is 6 ~ 6.5Gbs.**Update** Dec. 9thI returned my previous 8gb Kindle paperwhite for th 32Gb version.

It was also non-responsive to touch about 50% of the time and very very slow.  No problem with the power cord.  I have Paperwhite that I bought in 2016 and I loved it.  The last update wrecked the battery, so I ordered this new version.  I wasn’t interest in the audio feature as I have dealt with crappy speakers on Kindle products (including my Fire HDX 8.9) for years. I also wasn’t interestd unless it had Immersion reading.  Switching back and from audio to reading is awkward and distracting. I need the earphone plug port.  Can’t use earbuds and the headphones get incredibly hot. I have some over ear hinge sets with small light foam ear pads that sit on the outer ear (Panasonic) that are all I can use but they don’t come wireless.  External speakers are out of the question because of living situation.

I have to set the brightness to around 17 to get the same brightness my old PW had set at 4.  The Fire HDX 8.9 was great...except it was hard on my eyes and then it got very temperamental.  I’m trying not to have it die on me and the Paperwhite was a perfect companion.  Until it wasn’t, with this new version.  I’m keeping this replacement Paperwhite because I need the ereader.  Anyone who has an older version should wait until a better upgrade comes out.  There is nothing about this one that makes the trade worth it.I simply can’t understand why Amazon Would come out with an inferior e-reader for the Audible listening/Immersion reading experience when they push the Immersion experience so hard.  What they did was degrade the actual reading experience.  Amazon can do better because the *have* done better.My experience with Customer Service for the return was excellent.  The secret is to get an actual Kindle CS rep.  I believe you go up a tier and they are more experienced and have more latitude with making adjustments.  And yes, the language barrier can be problematic, especially if one has hearing issues.  But the CS reps have always been courteous, and in this day and age that counts for something.",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/R27ZF9RR7PBK4Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"November 13, 2018",13

The battery life on that one was a least a month up until I dropped it and it died a horrible death on 11/2. I had already pre-ordered this one so once I got it it took way too much to get it synched to how I work (Collections). The way to get this all transferred was so non-intuitive. I can't believe the developers thought this was an okay way to do things.Also, the battery life on this unit is horrible at this point. I'm still working with power stuff, but this is horrible. This thing only lasts about 3 days right now. My previous one lasted at least 3 weeks.Update: 12/9/18:madelene.mj@gmail.com916 9610853curtis.robinson1960@gmail.com209 507 1174This is an update to my previous review.If in the past you used your tablet (apple or android), then some of this review won’t concern you. I would say go ahead and buy it as you were already dealing with battery life and a lot of the features on this one weren’t available to you.However, if you were a previous Kindle user, don’t buy this. Yet. The reason I originally ordered this one is that it’s water resistant. I’m going on vacation over the holidays and will be in the hot tub and wanted to read in there. I also live in a very hot area and haven’t used my water misters because I didn’t want to ruin my previous Kindle. This one fit in perfect with that.A day or so before my new one arrived, I broke my old one. So, it was fortuitous that I had this pre-ordered.Like I said in my previous review, getting the content the way I had it (Collections), was way too hard to get it that way. This is one of the options that Amazon offered so I would have expected that it would be a seamless transition. Nope.I can't sync my Kindle Unlimited anymore. All I get is the dreaded: The book is currently unable. Please try again at another time, blah, blah when I'm trying to bring down a Kindle Unlimited book (I'm a subscriber)This is after about 8 hours last time I tried.At this time, I can’t in good conscience, recommend this to current Kindle users. I’ve tried so many things to get the battery life on this to be longer than a couple days. But even when it’s just sitting, there’s some process that is consuming battery life.I’ve tried:Disabling the clock. Made no difference.My “light” is set at 5. There’s a primary sleep mode on this unit that does make the display light up brighter than your existing sleep mode. However, I don’t think this is the cause of any issues when it comes to power. It engages when your Kindle has not been in use for hours. This is different than when your Kindle goes to sleep.Wireless is off as well as Blue Tooth.What I do like is the ability to adjust so many settings for reading mode (including whether or not to turn the clock on or off) within the book. I think they call it theme. So many options there to choose from depending on your reading style.Also, I have video of my Kindle showing a green light that indicates that it was fully charged, however it showed it was only at 98%. This really indicates to me that there are definite battery issues between the Kindle operating system and the Kindle itself.I suspect that that Amazon is trying to unify the Kindle Fire and Kindle Paperwhite’s code and they’ve done a horrible job. I don’t think they’ve done any beta testing and released this thinking all was well.It’s not.",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/R3BT8W4E3TOG34/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"November 14, 2018",15

It had great battery life and I found a not too expensive case for it which made me love it more. Fast forward to today. Ive had the new Kindle Paperwhite for a week and here are some impressions. The battery life is not as good. Not sure if its a software issue but even in airplane mode it seems to drain fairly quickly. I am also having issues with book lag. Every few pages I will tap the screen and the words will just stay there. I tap again and of course it moves two pages. I contacted Amazon and they said simply restart the kindle. That seemed to work for a bit but it started doing it again. It was on several books and not just one so I already tried deleting and reinstalling the books. The Kindle is just a week old so maybe there are some kinks out there that are in the process of being worked out but so far Im regretting turning in my older heavier kindle for the brand new one. If you have the old one and it still seems to be running fine, I would say stick with it until Amazon has some fixes for the new one. The battery life difference can not be understated.Update 12/10/18Praise the Lord: After a month of my kindle being so buggy that i barely touched it Amazon released a software update that from what I can tell has fixed all of the issues that I initially stated above.

I NEVER had these problems with my old Kindle, but this one has reset itself three times in three months. (Not even counting the yep times that the Amazon help line instructed me to manually deregister and/or reset to factory, so kinda give times total in a way).Each time this happens, all my downloaded books are erased and I have to download them all again. One of the main reasons I bought this one was that it had more memory so I could store more books on it. I have a moderate but still limited data plan (15GB), and each time I have to reload all of the 900 books in my ""unread"" pile it puts me over my monthly limit. So now I am completely dissatisfied with the Paperwhite! There's something fundamentally wrong with it's programming. Maybe someday they'll put out an update that fixes that a but until then its value is reduced considerable.***END OF EDIT***My old (very old) Kindle isn't usable any more, so I got another one. I used to have a Kindle Touch - they don't even make those anymore; haven't for years. I'm sure all the ones that came in between have had gradual changes that may or may not have carried through to this one, but I actually expected it to be a lot more different than it actually is. Go figure.Some things are better. Some are worse.Battery life seems about the same to me. I live in the middle of nowhere and there's no cell service most places. My old one would last for weeks when I lived in the city but only a few days out here. Or maybe a week if I turned off wireless. This one about the same. With wireless on it's good for about 2 or 3 days. On airplane mode for much longer.It came at about ⅔ charge, which was a nice surprise.There's no way to have it auto-detect which books were loaded on the old Kindle and reload them, so that kinda sucks. Gonna be a long long long process to weed through them all. :((Improvements:- Waterproof. Haven't tested that yet, but they claim it is. The old one was hard, but certainly not waterproof.- Smaller than my old one. Guess that's both good and bad. My eyes are ok but they won't be forever. So less words on a page doesn't matter at normal size but might be an issue when enlarged. But it's a good size anyway. The old one was just big enough that it wouldn't fit in a pocket, which means this one will. Well, not a jeans pocket, but a large pants pocket or a coat pocket. So that's good. And the case adds almost no size (my old one's case add a lot of bulk.- the smaller size also means it's easy to hold and use with just one hand. So that's a plus.- more memory. LOTS more. That's nice.What's worse:- swipe to unlock. Even after I put a password on it, the swipe feature is still active and can't be disabled. And from what I've read, it came be disabled even if you pay to remove the ads. I don't mind the ads really. Sometimes they're useful (usually not, but sometimes). So now when I pick it up it's on the ad screen because it's locked. Then I hit the button and the password screen comes up. Enter the code and then it goes back to the ad screen instead of opening up. Won't open until I swipe at the page to unlock it. That's really annoying. Maybe I'll get used to it eventually. Shrug.- no speaker. So you can only use audio books by connecting via Bluetooth to another device. Which I don't have and so would have to pay money for.- and no speaker means it also doesn't have the text to talk feature that my old Touch had. I mean, it sucked, I know. Mispronounced many words and most names, and paused at weird places. But still was usable in a pinch. Now it's just gone.- the timeout feature is annoying. The old one had that too but it did it better. If I get distracted and it decided to timeout and lock, it first dims the screen, which looks like it's giving a warning with a last chance to tap the screen to prevent it locking. But really it's already too late and you have to wait for it to finish and then hit the power button. So I've spent an annoying few times frantically swiping at the screen to no avail.... The interface is different and takes some getting used to, but that's neither good nor bad. Just makes it hard to find some menu options at first.Overall, it's decent. Somewhat overpriced though. I could buy a cheap tablet or large screen phone, root it and delete everything, and install the Kindle app. Then I'd have something almost as good (better in some ways) for maybe half what they are charging here. And it would be color too, so my graphic novels wouldn't look like crap (seriously, don't even try and do picture books on this.) So overall, it's just okay.Still...

I think it's nothing short of a masterpiece.  The battery life is literally weeks for a constant user, the device is lighter and easier to handle over long periods than the last Paperwhite, the screen is of exceptional quality and durability due to the fact that it is harder and flush with the casing now.  There's another thing to add yet: It's a great bargain.

I usually wait on new technology until all the bugs are out.  All the bugs are not out.1) This unit does not have the processing power to support smooth scrolling.  When I visit the home page to look at new books, there are scroll bars.  When I attempt to scroll with my finger, the page does not move with my finger as I would expect.  Instead it moves in big chunks after my finger has moved so far.  This behavior may have been acceptable ten years ago, but not now.  My eyes and brain expect the page to move along with my finger.  Consequently, I will not be using the home page for anything.2) This unit does not have the processing power to quickly handle page changes.  When I turn it on or go to new pages or go to settings or do anything that requires a refresh, I see new text on top of old for a brief second, which is distracting and just plain poor.  Also there are sometimes flashes of black screen added for further irritation.  Scrolling and changing pages are basic functions that the device should be able to handle smoothly.3) Pressing the left side of the screen to go to a previous page is totally unreliable.  Sometimes I'll get the previous page, sometimes I'll get the next page.  Multiple presses can cause looping.  Sometimes I get stuck in a loop between the next page and the current page, sometimes I'll get stuck in a loop between the previous page and the current page.4) As others have observed, the power plug is extremely difficult to connect.I do not recommend buying one of these.  I looked at reviews of the Oasis and the Fire and see more problems ahead.  For now I will stick with good old fashioned paper books.4 Dec 2018 update:  I tried the Kindle app on my android phone and it is vastly superior to the Kindle device.  Bright clear text, and the biggest plus by far is I can scroll pages smoothly up and down which is very intuitive and as fast as my finger can move.  Makes reading a pleasure rather than a chore.  Plus my phone is always with me so I don't have to carry around another device.  After comparing the two I don't know why anyone would want a Kindle.  Maybe someday when Kindles will have the processing power that phones have today enabling me to smoothly scroll through books instead of turning virtual pages I might consider one since they have more screen space than a phone.",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/R2D5Z5G7HV0B6C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"December 2, 2018",8

I could see the significant thought in both the materials and the design.  My first Kindle which I still use has endured YEARS of use and travel though the battery in it is now failing and the charge only lasts 2-3 days.  All of its buttons still work and its screen is a perfect display for text.  Years ago it was supported with both 3G and WiFi capability which set it apart from any e-reader of its day (I loved such superior design).  Now as soon as I opened the box for my new Kindle I began to see superior design again.  While it looked naked without all the keyboard buttons at the bottom or the paging buttons on the side, I was pleased with its crisp display and its ease of the auto setup menu.  Supposedly it is waterproof but I won't deliberately try to validate this feature.  (My old keyboard Kindle worked just fine in a ziplock plastic bag when used around water.)  I often wake at night and have to turn on a light in order to read my old Kindle (which I keep under my pillow).  This new ""paper white"" Kindle has it own light which is a great improvement for night time use.  My library was immediately down loaded into this new Kindle for which I was greatly pleased.  I was afraid to buy a new Kindle thinking I was being disloyal to my old Kindle...a trusted friend capable of calming my soul on a bad day or simply entertaining or educating me with the push of a button.  If I went camping or boarding an airline, my Kindle was my constant companion and my intellectual superior ready to mentor me in an instance.  I could not ""trade in"" my old friend.  If it reaches a severe state of decline, I will retire it on a shelf alongside my old slide rule as a reminder that some technology really does advance human capabilities.  So, for now, I will continue to appreciate my new ""paper white"" Kindle as a new friend with new adventures and deep thought ahead as we daily enter the future with its curiosity and discovery in the elation and enlightenment of the gift of life.",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/R1OW1TKZWA8CAG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"November 13, 2018",8

Another two hours on the phone; finally told for him he FIRST tme that cellular connectivity is ONLY available with the twice-the-price 32 gig version!!!  I went back to website - the Kindle is advertised as a version that has wi-fi + cellular connectivity. It NO WHERE  indicated to hat you have to buy the expensive 32 gig version to have  cellular connectivity included when you pay extra for wireless.  This is so he 6th(!) Kindle I have ordered, and every one of then until now had cellular connectivity.  The Kindle website gives absolutely no indication that the 8 gig does not include cellular connectivity - indeed, the specs for ordering state “wireless + cellular connectivity.”After all my years of loyalty to the Kindle, I disappointed and angry at what appears to be a false product description and a blatant Bait and Switch.  The remedy offered was a $35 credit in consideration of the six plus hours I spent on the phone, making it crystal clear I needed cellular connectivity!

On the positive side, it's very light weight and easy on eyes.------------------------------------Before I even received the new Kindle Paperwhite, I got a welcome email from Amazon in which it casually mentioned small number of users are having trouble inserting the included USB cable into the device. Upon receiving the new Kindle I found I had the exact problem. But I have a Samsung Android phone charging cable so I was able to charge the Kindle. Later I found two more USB to Micro USB cables at home so I tried them. One worked and one didn't. So the problem isn't exactly on the included cable. It's more like a problem on the Micro USB connector on the Kindle. So if you're unfortunate enough to run into this problem you can try a different cable at home. I think over the time the connector will loosen up a little bit and eventually will work for all reasonably good cables.If you still want to get a new cable from Amazon, look in Amazon's welcome email. There is a paragraph mentioning this issue in which there is a link you can click for support. I chatted with Amazon and they said I need to order a cable from Amazon then contact them again. Once the cable is shipped they will credit the money back to you.Also within two hours the new Kindle crashed. I just pushed and held the power button long enough to make it reboot (for about 10-15 seconds). So far it hasn't crashed yet. So don't panic if that happens to you.

My one other minor complaint is where the on off button is located I turn my kindle of accidentally a lot it should be moved or recessed.So happy I upgraded my Paperwhite. The things I like better about the new Paperwhite are: It weighs less, the flat front, it’s waterproof and the auto light sensor.It’s like an ounce lighter that makes a huge difference when marathon reading.The flat front is so much better you don’t have to lift your fingers from edge to turn pages. That doesn’t sound like much but it matters. Also the flat front doesn’t let stuff get stuck around the bezel like dog hair.It’s waterproof, that was my justification to upgrade. I float in the pool and read A LOT. I haven’t gotten it wet to try this feature out but if it happens and it’s not waterproof I’ll update my review.The light sensor is awesome. I did adjust my last kindle frequently and I don’t need to do that now.  I keep my light adjustment on the dim side.I loved my last Paperwhite but I think this one is definitely better.

The price is currently 180 USD and at the time of my purchase the base version was more like 120 USD.My main gripes are the poor UI that looks like something from a Nokia phone models back before flip phones existed, but after cell phones became more main stream. The glare-free screen is actually an anti-glare that negates the sharp light reflected off it from what I guess is the frosted screen. There's this annoying lag that also inverts the color when you flip through pages or try to use the native reading of a pdf file. From there it goes downhill to how the battery life isn't quite as promised, the paperwhite only comes with the micro USB and no actual charger so you have to plug it into another charger or a laptop, which takes well over the promised 4 hours charge time. There is no actual off, only sleep and turning off the screen so your device will most likely arrive half dead.Originally this was advertised as immersive with audiobooks and it made it seem like you could listen and read along, you can't. The waterproofing might work, but the mass produced care and maintenance notice tells you to not get it what and to quickly dry it off, the store page I believe advertises up to 2 feet in fresh water for an hour.A minor complaint is that it was already tied to my account upon receiving it, granted this was my first Amazon product of this nature so I just thought it was creepy. I later got a Fire7 to test the differences and at least bothered to ask if this was me or not.Also Amazon products really, really, really seem to hate any attempt at trying to use non-Amazon products on them. For the paperwhite I was trying to load up my library of Tabletop RPG books and figured an e-reader, especially this new one that touted native pdf reading (as previous generations didn't have that) would work well. It's really bad as a pdf reader at this price tag. (The Fire has issues trying to get GooglePlay or anything sideloaded as well, but that's another product). If you like reading regular text only books in a standard non-column format that is available from Amazon, then the paperwhite is amazing, you could also probably just get an older generation for cheaper unless you really need it to be waterproof.Sorry if this review isn't as organized or well written as it should be, but there was an error while trying to submit and I can't retype everything perfectly.",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/RPFFJ61WVLUOD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"December 8, 2018",7

But on the other hand, it seems subtly grayer, with poorer contrast, and greater glare. I'd still call it an overall improvement over the PW2, but didn't expect such a trade-off.- Adds waterproofing, Audible support, greater storage, and smaller size.

Previously, I had the 7th generation that I bought back in 2013.

It also has more storage space and some of the features (Goodreads, for example) have been updated. Another huge plus is having audiobooks on this kindle (though you do need a blu-tooth headphone set). I listen to a TON of audiobooks, so this is super useful for me. Also the 6 months of kindle unlimited doesn't hurt. The battery lasts much longer than my old paper white and as mentioned before, it is notably lighter than my old one.For me, this was well worth the money because of the type of reader I am.

Double capacity, a tad extra light to read in the dark with (one of my *favorite* features).  Other than those two bonuses, the 10th is a decided several steps backwards.First one arrived the day after release - total lemon.  No cushioning in the comparatively huge shipping box which may have contributed to its problems, the device was absurdly non-responsive, took nearly 10 minutes just to register basic info - and that was skipping all extras.  After speaking with THREE customer service reps in India (srsly), I was instructed to return the device for an exchange.  The next morning, a ""special team"" member began emailing me with instructions on how to return it on Amazon's dim.  I re-packaged the reader in the same box it arrived in and dropped it off with UPS.The next business day, my replacement arrived.  This one proved to be much better than its unfortunate predecessor.  However, the 10th gen still has what I consider to be puzzling issues.  As mentioned by others, it is sluggish, especially when compared to the 7th.  A page often needs to be swiped two or three times before anything happens.  Downloading a single book is very fast, but anything more than three books queued causes catastrophic failure (refuse to dl or cherry-picks which ones it *does* download).Whoever decided that reading a mere HALF HOUR A DAY is what the average purchaser of a purely reading device does really should rethink.  The battery (even on the 7th) will NOT last ""weeks"", even if you do not use the light or read for more than a half hour a day.  If you use the back light at all - one of the major advantages of the Paperwhite - your battery will drain in days, maybe a week, depending on how much you read.  Today was the first time I've used the back light, and the battery is noticeably drained after only an *hour* with the light set relatively low.Of course, now I can drop my reader in the bathtub or a pond for an hour, and theoretically it'll be fine.  Whooptidoo.Overall, I'm not impressed with the 10th gen.  But I do love the Paperwhite in general.  We have a seriously large 'real' library at home, and this adds over a thousand electronic volumes (so far) to it as well as the ability to check out library books to read at odd hours, while camping, etc.  Except for the added storage, I almost wish I had my 7th gen back.",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/R2EAMG4YRTU71T/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"November 23, 2018",7

If I could snap my fingers & have my previous kindle back, I’d do so in a heartbeat. I have a large digital library so the main reason I went for the upgrade was for more storage capacity & faster processor.* I purchased the 32GB storage capacity and found it was false advertising. Brand new, the storage capacity is 27GB. Amazon should be honest about the actual storage capacity-I still would have purchased the 27GB storage but don’t appreciate being lied to.* The Kindle Gen6 is what I traded-in & other than the storage capacity, my biggest frustration was the slow processor speed. Shame on me for not researching more, but this Gen10 kindle does not improve this issue & I find is even a bit slower than my Gen6 was.* The battery is worse on this kindle than my previous version. As others have stated, if you leave it connected via WiFi it drains the battery to 0 in less than 30 minutes.  In airplane mode, it’s better but not as good as my previous kindles were. I suspect we’ll see battery life deteriorate with each new kindle version in order to encourage users to upgrade more often.* Size of the Gen10 is a teeny tiny bit smaller than previous versions so of course you can’t use your existing cover on it & have to buy a new one.* Books do not automatically download during the set up process as it did with the Gen6. This is a huge pain for anyone with a large library esp bc Amazon does not let you manage/view your content by Collection.  Amazon should work on something to better the “Manage your content & devices” section to make it a better customer experience.* Collections-where to begin on this mess.  I found out the hard way that when you add/remove books from your collections on the kindle, it does not always transfer the info back to Amazon’s site. --> My digital content was so messed up that I decided to clean it up on the site & then reset the Gen10 & set it up again. This tooks hours & hours bc the Amazon site is not user friendly at all. --> Even after my clean up on the Amazon site, some books downloaded into the wrong collections. I double checked the site & it was correct too but the books showed up on the Gen10 in the incorrect collections. -->After the reset, I did not push any books to the Gen10 from the site & manually downloaded books only from a few of my collections. Yet this kindle automatically downloaded more but not all of my library to the kindle. So I’ll spend more hours cleaning this up on the Gen10 to get it organized.I received this new Kindle on Jan 28, and as of today Feb10 I am still working to get the device and content set up properly.  I would NOT advise anyone to purchase this Kindle.  It’s not a fix for a very slow processor speed and has bugs.

I wanted a device for my grandchildren (ages 5 and 9)  to read, without being distracted by games.  It is extremely lightweight for sure, but it is tiny.  The amount of actual page size is only 3 x 4, and with a reasonable font size (for small children or older adults) barely a paragraph of text displays.In addition, the screen response is extremely slow taking well over a second to turn pages, with a very distracting flashing fade in/out for any graphics on the page, especially when changing screens (returning home, etc.).  Response time on the actual touch screens is very slow for anyone used to using a tablet.The most disappointing for me is that it is all black and white.  It honestly never occurred to me that children's books would be black and white as well.  As I bought this as a gift for my grandchildren to read library books and such, I don't think this will be used at all (who wants a gorgeous picture book in black and white?).  It will be returned...for the almost $200 cost (with cover and charger, etc.) I expected much more.Update:  Received a call from Amazon to try to resolve some of my issues.  Really appreciated, but in discussion, tried downloading more children's books that I had previously purchased through Amazon.  Imagine our surprise to learn that most of them would not download with an ""incompatible format"" error...these are KINDLE books, from Amazon, and they don't work on a KINDLE!  While I appreciated the attempt to resolve the issues, the additional flaw for children (the point of my purchase) makes the device sub-par.

Sometimes, it takes a full day to actually appear.  And, no, I'm not going to do a factory reset, as it took me three days to get my items downloaded!!  Now, the content DOES appear immediately for my Kindle Fire device.  I do not understand why the content does not appear immediately for this Paperwhite device.  So far, if I have it plugged into A/C power, items will appear faster, AND if I order the content from my computer, and not my smartphone.Another complaint is that the book covers don't appear properly due to a software glitch.  Perhaps this glitch is also responsible for the lack of speed in showing new cloud content, too.I do like the lighting, and I do love the bigger memory.  That was my biggest problem with my older devices.  I probably could've gotten away with the 8 gig model, but I chose the 32 gig model.  My library is almost 1700 items, and I have about 1300 downloaded onto the Paperwhite.  That's why it took three days to set it up.Maybe I need to break it in more.  I will give it more time, though.  I do hope Amazon fixes these two problems.Thanks for reading.ADDED ON 1/22/2019:  It has gotten better, and my purchased items are showing up much more quickly.

I have owned a previous version of the paperwhite, the voyage, the first oasis (for a few days before I sent it back), and the new oasis with the 7” screen. This is by far my favorite.I really liked the larger oasis when I first got it, but after awhile I got tired of the body style. I was tired of flipping the entire device every 2 minutes when I would switch hands (I didn’t realize how much I adjusted my grip until this device made me aware of it.) I also read in bed a lot and having practically no bottom bezel made the bottom of the page disappear into the pillow I would rest it on. Also while reading in bed it was more comfortable to grip the oasis on the top instead of the side to steady it, where there is almost no bezel. So that would lead to constantly accidentally opening the settings. I put up with it for the larger screen, water proofing, and the black and white invert.This kindle paperwhite is the best of all worlds. The flush screen means debris can’t get trapped between the bezel and the screen, it’s waterproof, it has the black and white invert which is SUPER important to me because I have light sensitivity issues, it has a nice size bezel to hold onto any way you want, and the screen is plenty bright with no shadows at the bottom like the previous paper white version.This device is hands down a five star product.

My former device was starting to have some glitches because it was getting old.  Amazon did a ""factory reset,"" and that ruined the device so completely that I had to get this new model.  It came with all sort of bells and whistles that I didn't ask for and didn't want, and had other issues that even the Amazon/Kindle support staff couldn't figure out either.  They did another ""factory reset,"" and sure enough, that ruined that device as well.  I'm now using yet another replacement device, but this one came with an app for automatic pop-up ads.  When I called customer service, the fellow said the app was part of the basic package.  I said I hadn't asked for it and didn't want it, and he said he'd have to charge me $5 to get rid of this extra add-on.  (In fact, I raised such a stink that he didn't.)  I managed to disable other functions I don't want (highlighting, for example), but there are still big problems.  The device downloads books MUCH more slowly than my first Kindle.  Even though the book I'm reading now is supposed to be ""footnote capable,"" if you tap on the underlined footnote number, it just goes to a different page than the one you're on, not to the footnote.  If you log off and then log back on, it does not take you to the page where you were reading, but to one several pages away (in either direction).  In one instance, when I re-opened a book I'd read about 30% of, it took me to ""the last page you read,"" which was 3 full chapters BEFORE the last page I'd read.  If you tell it to go to a location and give it the number, again, you'll go to some other number usually within about 10 either side of the you want.  You also can't remove a book from the device (and the Amazon/Kindle guy couldn't do it either) -- you have to go to your Manage Content and Device function and delete it from that, which means that if you want to read it again, you have to buy it again.  The old Kindle wasn't like this.  I rebooted just now, thinking that might solve some of the immediate problems, and it took almost 5 minutes for the device to get back to my home page.

In fact, it was going to be my Christmas present. The description made me think it would be a beefed up, touch-screen version of the older Kindle keyboard with free 3G service. I can hardly describe my level of disappointment, but I’m going to try so you can save yourself the money and the hassle.First, I will give the few positives. The device is a light weight, the paperwhite screen is a good feature, and the light is handy. That’s it on the plus side.For the negatives, (1) The power button is on the bottom, so I am constantly accidentally locking or shutting off the unit (2) Amazon didn’t include a charger plug, just a USB cord (Really, at this price point?). (3) No external speaker. I could live with this if I could easily pair to external Bluetooth speakers or earbuds, but nothing about this device is intuitive or easy. Once you pair a device, you will constantly be kicked out of text to speech (now called VoiceView) by notifications or by accidentally touching the screen (ironically the only time the screen is semi-responsive). (4) Poor touch screen sensitivity on everything expect page turning and when in VoiceView (5) Incomprehensibly bad text to speech/VoiceView. I can’t imagine trying to use this feature if I were visually impaired. Simply finding the buried volume control is ludicrously difficult. I double touched and double touched trying to get the volume to change.  It just kicks you out. (6) Once you are in VoiceView, the only workable way to navigate is to shut off your Bluetooth speaker or earbud and go back to the home screen, turn the Bluetooth back on from your speaker, and then finally go back into your book. (7) Every option is buried. I just friggin want listen to a book using VoiceView/Text to Speech, not hunt and hunt for everything! (8) The battery life is not weeks, in my experience.  I started with a full battery and had to charge it up after six hours. (9) The suggestions and ads are intrusive. I didn’t pay for an ad free device, I get that; however, past devices had confined the selling to the lock screen or suggestions at the end of a book. They are in your face now. Note, while digging through layers of menus, I did run across the option to turn off suggestions. (10) I was never able to listen to any of the Audible books that I have already purchased. Amazon is very anxious to get you to buy more books, but not so eager to let you listen to ones you already own. Yes, I did call for help. No, I didn’t get help. I still haven’t a clue what the rep said. She just read some spiel from a script about the wonders of Audible in attempt to sell me a subscription and I don’t think she even knew, let alone cared, about resolving what I had called about. I could go on and on, but you get the point. (11) When you are in Text to Speech/Whatever the heck they call it now, there is loud, awful noise that interrupts the story at the end of every page. (12) The free 3G did not work. I put it right next to an old Kindle Keyboard with free 3G and the old model did work.I get the impression that different groups designed different areas of the device and they didn’t ever speak to each other, they just dumped everything together into this clunky embarrassment of a device. Did they even let a few end users try this thing? My recommendation? Buy a basic paperwhite or better yet, go to Ebay and buy a Kindle keyboard with free 3G. They work a lot better than this. I'm returning this for refund and will start looking for a Kindle keyboard myself.I have become more and more disenchanted with Amazon, but their e-readers and tablets have been reasonably good, at least until the past few generations. Software issues, battery issues, SD/memory issues, and poor designs are piling up and I have become more and more frustrated. Kindle support used to be a selling point, but now I can’t even get decent trouble shooting. Calling Amazon and being told to shut the device off (by someone I can’t understand and who can’t understand me) and then sending it back to Amazon isn’t device support. It’s laziness and poor service. I have over 30 kindle e-readers and tablets, so I’m not a novice user. For the first time, I’m looking at other companies for e-readers because Amazon is no longer cutting it.",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/RBBWJPKATH7AD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"December 10, 2018",5

Thinking of returning and getting back my old paperwhite, if possible.Update: An Amazon representative contacted me concerning my one star rating. He suggested that I use the airplane mode, this would prevent the device from power drain as it attempts to connect to the internet. I always select the screen off before closing cover. I charged to 100%, selected airplane mode and screen off and then left the Kindle on the shelf for several days. When I opened it, the battery was at 75%. The battery is no better than my original Paperwhite. Sorry to have wasted over $100 on this.

First off the new screen is awful and gets covered in finger prints, which was never an issue with the texture of the old screen.  Second, there is no option that I can find to sync the device, only individual books.  I changed the name of a collection on Amazon and have since restarted the Paperwhite twice and it will not update the collection name on the device.  Third Audible needs some major work.  I have four books from the same author where I own the kindle version and the Audible version.  Three of those sync up so that I can go to that collection and have one icon for the book from which I can access the Kindle and the Audiobook.  For the forth book the kindle version shows up in the correct collection but the Audible version shows up on my homescreen and does not offer the option to combine the two or to add it to the collection.  I have one additional audible book downloaded that is also stuck on my home screen despite it being part of a collection that is also downloaded onto the device.  So basically I am unable to organize my home screen because the Audible books won't go into a collection unless you also own the kindle version, and even then it only works 75% of the time.I wish I could have a do-over and get my old Paperwhite back and just stick to using my phone for Audible.",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/RCWC6F79QWNLI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"November 30, 2018",5

But often I would buy books for the Kindle app on my iPad and get about a quarter of the way through and I would stop.  The purchased books would form a virtual pile up in the app as my bank account would dwindle and serve as a source of guilt for spending the money and not finishing what I started.  But then I borrowed one of my kids Kindle's and gave it a try.  The fact that it is just an e-reader is its main virtue.  While reading, there are no pop-ups, no emails, no other electronic temptations to distract me from the pure joy and simply reading.  At the same time, I rediscovered the library, well the electronic library and the ability to borrow e-books direct to my Kindle using the Libby app on my iPhone.  Since this Kindle/Libby revelation I have read 4 novels (I am enjoying Dan Brown's books very much) in about 4-5 weeks.  The library books are available for 21 days which puts a healthy pressure on me to read them in a timely manner.  In this middle of all this the new Kindle Paperwhite 4 came out...I ordered it right away and actually use it as much for work (reading e-textbooks) during my commute as for novels at the gym.

gina,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFN3I44NQH3MJR7P6QL6U736TNPA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,An awesome upgrade from the Kindle App!,5,Verified Purchase,Digital Storage Capacity: 32Offer Type: With Special OffersColor: BlackOption: Without Kindle Unlimited,"Before purchasing this product, I was using the Kindle App on my iPad Mini. Had it for two years before the app started to lag and crash starting a few weeks ago. I've had my eye on getting a Kindle for awhile and finally got around to purchasing the All-New Paperwhite with 32 GB. It's been several days since I've had it and I have to say, I'm totally impressed.For someone like me who's an avid e-reader and has 4,000+ books in their Kindle account, this device is perfect for suiting their needs. FIrst of all, the display is gorgeous. I love how crisp the lettering is and how the pages actually look like real paper. There's barely any glare on the screen when held up in sunlight -- a huge advantage over the iPad Mini even with the light sensor it has built in. There's a very, very slight glare the ANPW gets when in direct sun, but it's easily rectified by changing the brightness of the screen or tilting it at a closer angle. It hasn't been a problem for me so far and I doubt it will be.The same goes with the storage. I have over 4,000 books and have only used 5 GB out of the 32, and none of my books are audiobooks. Super encouraging to know that I could potentially triple my book count without the Kindle lagging because that was one of the main reasons I switched over from the App.Another huge improvement is how LIGHT this device is. I have small hands and they'd get tired after a few hours of holding the iPad. But so far I've seen I can go all day holding the ANPW without experiencing any fatigue in my fingers or wrists -- that includes having a cover on it. And while I haven't had it long enough to test out whether the battery actually lasts for weeks, I will say that I've only charged it twice since receiving it and that wasn't because the battery was dead but simply because I wanted to. However, if I actually discover that the battery doesn't last for weeks like it's advertised to, I won't complain because it's still longer lasting than my iPad.In general, this device is superior to the app as well as Nook products. I've had three different Nooks before switching over to Kindle and none of them were as easy to navigate as the ANPW is. With my Kindle, I can transition easily from reading, to the store to my goodreads account, and back to where I left off in a book. Nothing takes more than a second to load and I don't have to worry about getting lags in the process -- as I've experienced none so far. This device is everything I wanted to be and more. Has my entire Amazon/Kindle account installed including my wish list, goodreads, and store preferences easily loaded in once set-up is complete, not to mention all the storage, a great battery life (so far), and the best display I've seen on an e-reader to date. If you're looking at getting this Kindle as an upgrade from the App like I was, I bet you'll become as obsessed with this device as I have. 5+++++ stars and highly recommend!",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/R3RNZ3ITUWQ7V5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"March 3, 2019",4

I had bought the Kindle Fire when it first came out years ago and HATED it. I vowed never to buy another kindle and decided to download the free kindle app on my other devices instead.My main issue with reading on the kindle app on my Apple devices is that there is so much glare. It makes it pretty much impossible to read at the beach or anywhere where you’re getting a lot of sunlight. My iPad and iPhone would overheat when reading outside at the beach or the pool, so I pretty much gave up on that.This year, I am traveling to many different countries and have been reading more than I have ever been. I did not want to take physical books with me on trips for the obvious reason that it takes up space and weighs down my luggage. That’s when I decided to see about the kindle paper white.My sister in law has a previous version (one without the back lights) and told me how she really enjoyed it. I decided to go ahead and order one for myself (the newest generation).Man, am I pleasantly surprised by this device. It’s compact, portable, really minimizes glare, and the backlight is phenomenal for reading in different lighting. In fact, I can now read in the dark without keeping my husband awake with a reading light. With that being said, there are something’s that I found in the reviews to be misleading.1. Battery Life: battery life on this device is phenomenal. When I first received the kindle I fully charged it. I have been reading on my kindle since last week for hours at a time and have yet to charge it again. It’s currently at 76% and it started at 100%.With that being said, if you’re reading with the backlight on constantly the battery is not going to last as long because (obviously) the backlight will use more energy.2. Anti-Glare: I’m actually really surprised how many people comment and complain about the anti-glare on this device. If you hold the kindle under direct light of course you’re going to get a slight glare, it’s not a book, it’s a device with a screen. The glare on the device is absolute minimal and haven’t noticed it when I’m actively reading. I only notice it when I’m picking it up to read.3. Water-Resistance: I would absolutely avoid submerging this device (or any other water resistent devices). I have not tested the water resistance, nor will I purposely do so as the water may not do damage internally but externally to the device (i.e., the charging port WILL rust). I would definitely take this to the beach or the pool with me and am not worried at all about spilling stuff on it or touching it with wet hands.4.Finger print resistance: I’m not really going to comment on this. Nothing is truly finger print resistent and if it bothers you carry a cleaning cloth with you.I love having the ability to buy books right off of my kindle and being able to read them right away. I’m so glad that I purchased this device. I don’t have to drain my phone battery reading on the kindle app, my husband can now sleep while I’m awake reading, and my luggage doesn’t have to weigh a million pounds while I travel country to country.",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/R3U365FBDVEN2F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"January 20, 2019",4
Dennifer,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AG34HM6G452FPFNRT4SXZ2Q46DNA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,I'll keep this review Long,5,Verified Purchase,Digital Storage Capacity: 8Offer Type: With Special OffersColor: BlackOption: Without Kindle Unlimited,"Don't listen to the entitled.TLDR; Just y**tube reviews of it. There are tons of unboxing/review videos. If you are a surgeon shopper like myself, do it and then decide. Cheers!Ahh 2018... the year of entitlement and review bombing. For the record, this thing is the same or better in every way then is predecessor. Period. All the bad reviews are old-timers who don't understand how device upgrades work (even comparing it to completely different models - ""The power button is on the bottom when before it was on the back..."" -Old woman from Happy Gilmore. That's because it not the Voyage 2. And now good news boys and girls - Arts and crafts time has been extended by 2 hours today), or young people who are entitled. Could there be a bad batch out there? Sure, but that doesn't explain away the outright misinformation. People are just complaining to complain, yet offering no actual constructive criticism.So comparing this Paperwhite 4 to previous ""Paperwhites,"" let me address the BS:-Someone said you can't adjust the read time/% left on the page anymore, unless you go into settings. BS!-Someone said the screen temperature is yellow (more yellow than the Paperwhite 3 - Bad Batch?). BS! And Amazon will exchange it for you for this reason.-Someone said the battery is SUPER bad and only lasts 6 hours before needing a charge. Complete BS!-Someone said it's not waterproof. BS! And just plain stupid as that's a main selling point (watch y**tube peeps)-Someone said you can't invert the colors for night reading like the Oasis. BS!-Someone said the screen being flush is worse. BS! This is subjective, but honestly it's easier to clean now.-Someone said it's lighter and hence flimsier. Half BS! They are correct, it is lighter! BUT there is nothing more flimsy about this than the Paperwhite 3, BS!-Someone said it's slower. BS! It has a new ultra power-saving mode which can make it take 3-5 sec more at startup, which you can disable in the settings. SETTINGS > DEVICE OPTIONS > ADVANCED OPTIONS > POWER SAVER. Other than that, it is just as fast. If yours isn't, you got a dud so exchange it.-Someone said the screen isn't 10"" ...no comment.-Someone said it doesn't support games *blink blink* Did you think you were buying a PS4?-Someone said there's no improvements over previous models. uh... BS! Read below.These are legitimate reviews on here. Talk about first world entitlment problems. Coming from a Paperwhite 3, this is pretty much the exact same ereader, but with some serious improvements laid out below:-Is lighter yet just as firm as previous model-Is waterproof (Seriously watch y**tube. This thing takes a bath in a vat of soda, tomato sauce, oil, honey, and water, you name it and survives just fine).-Has 8gb of storage.-Is every bit as white as Paperwhite 3 (There could be a bad batch, fair enough, but mine is more white, so they apparently fixed it)-Battery life is just as good as Paperwhite 3 (maybe a little better per ultra power saving mode)-Has night mode. Can invert colors - this was the true selling point for me (no more disturbing my wife at night), and it is beautiful and uniform-Flush screen makes it easier to swipe, clean, and the new soft screen is easier on the fingers-Bluetooth. Can listen to audible now-It has an Ultra Power Saving mode now to conserve even more battery when idle. Yes, this is a pro. People are confusing this as the device is now slower for no reason. There's a reason, it's saving your battery even more than previous models. Furthermore, you can turn it off if you want your 3-5 seconds back.Everything else is pretty much the same, which isn't a bad thing.Does that sound like no improvements? Just because some/any of those pros don't apply to you doesn't mean it doesn't apply to everyone. Only you can decide if the new features will be worth it for you, but it DOES provide the new features Amazon said it does. Complainers will complain. Ironic how none of these complainers ever put in their input on the features they feel would be the ""huge improvements"" they want, no, they just complain. People even complained it doesn't match previous cases... *blink blink* when has a new model on any device - ever, done this? Truly these are first world problems and entitlement issues.Is it a HUGE upgrade over the Paperwhite 3, Voyage, or Oasis? No. Can it make you steak and eggs and rub your feet? No. Did Amazon tout is as such? No. Is it a refresh of an already good ereader with some cool new features? Yes. And to some people those might be pretty BIG upgrades (waterproof is pretty big if you read by the pool, beach, or bath tub. Lighter might mean the world to someone with arthritis. Bluetooth & 8gb is awesome for the person on the train who wants audible).

Even after inverting black/white (!), the 10th gen Paperwhite on its dimmest lit setting (1) still puts out far more light than my older Paperwhites on their dimmest setting (0).On top of that, the brightness randomly flashes much brighter than the current setting when redrawing the screen.  It settles back to the assigned setting before it's done, but this is highly annoying at night.  Also, the inverted black/white sometimes seems to draw with normal white/black for a second before inverting them, which again doesn't work well at night.I like to read my paperwhite in bed while trying to fall asleep, and this just won't work for me at all.The screen lighting is much more even than older Paperwhites, so that is an improvement.  It's just too dang bright at night.Other people comment that the maximum bright setting isn't as bright as older generations.  I haven't observed that issue, but I can't expect any screen light to keep up with direct sunlight.  That's what the e-ink display is for.  Perhaps it's an issue with people not appreciating the ""warmer"" color temperature?During daylight, you can get better battery life by shutting the light off completely, but battery life was never a problem for me with the older Paperwhites anyway.Also, I find the 10th gen Paperwhite less comfortable to hold in my hand.  Perhaps some future silicone or rubber case may alleviate this concern.  Lackluster availability of cases is understandable for a brand-new product.On the plus side, I love the waterproof feature - the only water resistant case I ever liked was the discontinued Incipio Atlas.

I don't intend to get my PW wet, but nice to know if an accident does happen that it will be okay in the water for awhile at least.I got a nice discount on the price because my two previous Kindle Paperwhites were in good working order and I got the maximum trade-in for them. I did have to suffer fearsomely without any Kindle from the deadline for turning them in and the release of this model, 10 days! The previous covers do not work for this new PW, it fits in but falls out easily and the auto off-on feature doesn't work, so save yourself further compromise waiting for the complete Kindle PW experience and get the cover when you order.",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/RIYSV51RY1U1C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"November 20, 2018",4

When I tried to use the leather cover from the old model, it didn't fit at all. The old model cover runs big. I got the all-new water-resistant fabric cover for this model and it feels fantastic!- The front is one single panel, and the edges are now flat with the screen. At first, it feels weird to turn pages since the old model had a physical edge (higher than the screen). After getting used to it, it feels more smooth and more convenient to operate. - I traded in my old Kindle and used the promotion to get the 32GB memory version (the appraised trade-in value gift card+25% off+6mo Kindle Unlimited). I'm very excited to use the memory to save all the books and audio-books.- I have the Audible app on my phone, but the Kindle Paperwhite makes it more distraction-free. When you close the lid (or screen-saver mode), the audio still goes. But when you change to a different page, the audiobook stops (which means you have to stay on that page in order to listen to the book.) And you can start to listen even if the whole book hasn't fully downloaded yet. It also has all the necessary functions (like changing the reading speed, etc.)- The Bluetooth works perfectly with the Bose headphones and easy to set up. You can also turn it off when not using it to save the battery.- Another big plus feature and been anticipated for a long time is waterproof!! Love it!!

The 32GB is only necessary if you plan on storing a bunch of audiobooks on it at once, like more than 50. Since all of those are stored in the cloud anyway, it's likely that very few people need 32GB on their Kindle if you'd like to save a little money.

My parents gave me the new Paperwhite for Christmas and I am obsessed! It's been wonderful for reading at night, and I didn't think of my old kindle as old technology but man they've come a long way! I thought I'd miss having physical buttons, but there have only been a couple of times I've missed them - so far I'll chalk those up to adjusting to the touch screen. Highlighting passages is a little more difficult than before, but I'm sure I'll get used to it.""Special offers"" - I know some people are super bothered by the concept of advertising on your Kindle. My Keyboard had special offers, my Paperwhite does not. Having owned both, I can tell you I really don't notice a difference. Either way, there's a screensaver on your Kindle. If you're really concerned about the content of that screensaver, then splurge for the no special offers option, but I really haven't noticed a difference between the two options. I appreciate that my parents were willing to spend a little extra because they thought the ads would be intrusive, but I honestly never minded the offers in the first place, so it wouldn't have mattered.I have been using the accessibility option of having a black background and white text at night for even more comfort on my eyes, and the ability to have even less light coming at me before bed. It's been really nice. I do notice a bit of a blue cast on the screen when the backlight is on, if that matters to anyone. But I'm a photographer so I might be especially apt to notice color casts and minute details like that.All-in-all, I think this is an excellent product - and by the way, for anyone who thinks e-readers could never beat the feel of a real, paper copy of a book - I still have bookshelves full of hard copies, and I LOVE them. But I also love my Kindles for the portability, reading at night, travel, light weight, etc. I choose some books that I think I'll want to hold in my hand, and others that I think will be best for the screen.

I on average have to charge it every 2 days and I have not spent much time reading.  I have a feeling I will have to replace this much earlier than I have had to with my other kindles.There is something wrong with the connection cord and charger, you have to force the connection in to make it charge, which will also end up breaking earlier than expected.If you have the choice go with one of the older models and save yourself some money.My last paperwhite died a few weeks before this was released.Pro- you can get to collections much easier, I do not have to scroll through 30 pages of books to get to the collections now.  That is about the only pro over the other versions.Cons-- There are more adds,  On the home screen that you use to scroll past to get to another book, there are so many Add's that it is hard to navigate sometimes.- The on off switch is on the bottom in the middle and sticks out. If you set this on anything it will auto shut off while reading.

It is a significant update to the Paperwhite, and to summarize the changes made and how significant they are:1. It has a flush front screen for a much more attractive appearance. The Kindle Voyage and Oasis models have had flush screens but this is the first time that a lower-priced Kindle had this feature, and it is a nice improvement2. It’s slightly lighter and thinner than earlier models3. It’s waterproof, making it the second Kindle model (after the latest Oasis) to have that capability. This is a significant improvement.4. It has audio capability – using Bluetooth to connect to headphones or speakers, so you can listen to audiobooks. This is also a significant improvement for those users who enjoy audiobooks – previous Paperwhite models did not have this feature (but the other current Kindles – the Oasis 2 and basic Kindle – do)5. It has greater storage capability – double that of the previous Paperwhite (8 GB now, 4 GB before), with the ability to increase that to 32 GB. This is particularly useful if you have a lot of audiobooks since they use up much more storage spaceWith all of this, the new Paperwhite is only $10 more than the previous version, which makes it an even greater value in my opinion.Amazon’s Kindle line-up is now simplified to three models, and I have all of them so let me give my brief summary:- The ‘basic’ Kindle E-reader has a 6” screen, no lighting, touchscreen controls, and is the lowest cost Kindle for those who don’t need or want a lighted display- The latest Kindle Paperwhite (4th Generation) has a 6” screen, lighted display, touchscreen controls, greater memory and waterproofing. It’s really the best choice for most people, especially with these latest improvements- The top-of-the-line Kindle Oasis (2nd Generation) has the largest display (7”), lighted, touchscreen controls and page turn buttons, greater memory and waterproofing. For those readers who want or need the larger display or the buttons for turning pages, it’s a great e-reader - at almost twice what a Paperwhite costsThe bottom line is that, unless you really want the larger display of the Oasis (and it is nice, although it also makes the device a bit heavier and more bulky to hold), or really want the page turn buttons, then this new Paperwhite really provides everything most people want in their Kindle. Which is why it has been Amazon’s best seller, and I’m sure that this new version will continue the same.I’ve been a Kindle user since purchasing one of the first Paperwhite models in 2012. I spend some time reading every day. When e-readers, including the Kindle, first appeared, I wasn’t interested. I couldn’t imagine that reading with an electronic device would be as satisfying as holding a ‘real’ book in my hands was. Then, when the first lighted Kindle was introduced, I decided to give it a try. These days I find that I seldom buy or read ‘real’ books. It’s so convenient to be able to have a library of books in your hand, and the lighted Kindle is so much nicer for reading in bed than regular books.My favorite Kindles have been my Voyage (largely because the ‘Origami’ case makes it the most convenient to use when reading at a table or desk), and the new Oasis for reading in the evenings in bed. I’m going to give this new Paperwhite a try because I think that the lighter weight will make it even more comfortable to carry and use.",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/RJU34CMKPHSTF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"December 23, 2018",3

I need to increase the font to read easily. After an hour working with their service department in the Philippines I still cannot try out the audible feature.  They are going to call me back in an hour  in  the hopes that it completely down loads by then.  It is bad enough that all their service personnel live overseas.  Amazon earns so much money you would think that they would have a U.S. based service center.  Besides the often heavy accents of the service people, they are not as knowledgeable as they should be, b/c none of them owns a personal kindle.  They can only read on the one in the office there for all service personnel to use.  I'll bet that these cost no more than $5 to manufacture.  The service people in the offshore service centers do not earn enough to buy one at the retail price so they never become as proficient using it as they would be if they owned and used one for personnel pleasure.  It is just awful  that they neither pay enough to service people that they can afford their own kindle nor do they give them one for free to make sure they are fluent in its use.  Give your overseas service people a free kindle or sell them one for the equivalent of $5.  Then sell them their books at cost to you, Amazon.  How about it.Further, they have put a ""goodreads"" icon where the ""go to"" icon was.  I don't want it now or ever.  Goodreads is clearly an arm of Amazon so it never gives anything a bad review.  I don't want it on there.  When I tried to delete it, I was offered a choice of now or later.  The choice of no or never is not there.  I will have to spend another hour on the phone with Amazon service people in the Philippines to get rid of it.  It is not to Amazon's advantage to teach the foreign service people how to get rid of the icon easily so they don't.  It should be a one click removal function if it is there at all.  If you do buy version of the kindle request that it come without the ""goodreads"" icon. I promise you you don't need it and you really do need the ""go to"" icon.

I have an original Kindle Paperwhite I purchased in 2012 but I bought the new one because it had text-to-speech. My eyes don’t always read well because of eyestrain from working on a computer all day but I love to read and I also love to listen text-to-speech to avoid further eyestrain. I have been shopping for the perfect Kindle reader and I tried the Kindle Fire HD. I found that the HD to be too large and heavier then a Paperwhite although there text-to-speech is better.My original Kindle Paperwhite didn’t have text-to-speech which is why I decided to purchase a new one. I finally settled on the “All-new Kindle Paperwhite” but I’m sorely disappointed in its text-to-speech. I hadn’t realized that I can only do text-to-speech with Bluetooth headsets. I read and listen to books while I drive to work every day. I don’t listen to music I listen to books. I also wanted to avoid headphones because using headphones every day for well over twenty years is no longer good for my ears. Every day headphone use has caused many ear issues. The text-to-speech on the “All-new Kindle Paperwhite” is good but it would be better if the text-to-speech would only speak for the books. The Kindle text-to-speech for the menu item, the double tapping to select, and the clicking noise when changing the page is very annoying.Amazon needs to update their text-to-speech software for the Kindle Paperwhite. And allow the use of text-to-speech without headphones. I would return it but I still need a text-to-speech Kindle and since this one appears to be my only option I will probably have to keep it even though I’m not completely satisfied.UPDATE: This All-new Kindle Paperwhite was not bad, I love the size and weight. Of course, there are a few minor issues like the battery is not the same as my original Kindle Paperwhite and the size is slightly smaller so I cannot use the same Kindle case. The real problem is what I purchased it for, the text-to-speech. As mention in my original review above, I need the text-to-speech for the books only and not the home screen or menu items. For that reason, I am returning the All-new Kindle Paperwhite.

rkruz,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGPCXVNN5W5LKQHFBDAWSTMXBEPA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,Worth upgrade 5th to 10th gen?  Only if you use audible books,5,Verified Purchase,Digital Storage Capacity: 8Offer Type: With Special OffersColor: BlackOption: Without Kindle Unlimited,"Ill say upfront, Kindle is fantastic, has been for a decade!  I love the convenience of reading and accessing new books.  The Paperwhite reading page is easy on the eyes, precise fonts and backlit to read without additional light. And Im talking about my 5th gen that Ive used for years.  Five Stars all day long and for the past 8 years!  So yea, I give this new 10th gen Kindle 5 stars in this review  however from a different perspective is the upgrade worth it?Now.........I compared my 5th Gen to my just received 10th gen (no wifi with ads)  is it worth it to upgrade to the 10th generation Paperwhite?  If you just read books then probably not, here is why.........  --  Font resolution is the same:  This is the biggest upgrade issue for me.  The screen viewability. Well there may be more pixels on the screen with the 10th gen, to my eye when looking at the 5th and 10th side by side with the exact same settings for display and font my human eyes cannot perceive one iota of difference (see picture attached).  Amazon points out the improved font resolution but this make not difference to the end font presentation.  --  The 10th gen is faster.  Yes pages change a little faster and crisper with the 10th.  But again IMO not worth the cost of upgrading.  --  The 10th gen online book search is much faster and it works!.  My 5th gen was slow and often would not work when trying to find and research  new books to buy from the Amazon Kindle store.  This feature is supremely more usable with the 10th gen.  If this is how you shop for books then the upgrade from 5th to 10th is worth it.  If you like me, use your computer to search and manage your content then its not really that beneficial.  --  10th gen is waterproof.  I cant think of one instance in all the years Ive used my 5th gen Kindle that it was at risk of getting wet.  I gotta say for me its a nice to have but dont care.  --  Battery life:  I suspect the 10th gen is longer but the 5th gen lasts so long now, weeks for me, why do I care?  --  Lighter and thinner.  Yes it is.  Were talking an ounce here.  honestly i like a little more bulk to hold on to the thing.  When its put in a case then what does it matter.  --  A nice convenience on the 10th gen is that now I can return borrowed Kindle Unlimited books right from the Kindle rather then doing it when having to visit Amazons website and the content page.There is one reason to upgrade........  --  Audible content.  OK they got me here. This is one single most important difference between 5th and 10th.  The 10th can play audible content over a bluetooth device.  Yea thats pretty cool.  Ive not used audible books before but like other new things ""you dont know what your missing until you try it"".  This is probably the one feature that might make upgrading to the 10th gen worth it!  --  Well there is one more reason to upgrade...its cheap to upgrade.  If you get the ads, no wifi version and trade in the old kindle you get 25% off + a $25 gift coupon.  If you pay for Kindle Unlimited as I do you also get 6 months free even if you have an existing account....thats $60 savings.  So bottom line it cost me $20 to upgrade to the new 10th gen Kindle when trading in an old one and by golly im looking forward to trying out my 10th gen using those new fangled audio books!",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/R2LGJ388DTDF6I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"November 28, 2018",3

The battery is dreadful and seems to drain even when the Kindle is off. Mine went from 97 to 63 overnight even though the device was off. The charge lasts significantly less time than my previous Paperwhite. It was disappointing to discover that it was not waterproof but water resistant as a cover or a baggie would have solved the getting caught in the rain issue.I hate the home page format as the list version was easy to read and the covers are almost impossible. I’m very sorry I bought this.I'm updating to say that I was able to change from cover view to list view, although it took a lot of searching.I did receive a call from Amazon Support within an hour of my review and they suggested rebooting and getting back to them after a couple of days to see if the situation with the charge improved. It's been three days and the device is at 62%, so that's an improvement but may also be due to turning off the WiFi that I'd never used. I'm still sorry that I traded in my old paperwhite, but will wait and see what's next AND wait until the next version is out for a while and has several hundred reviews.",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/R2MQTRBR8Q4DXL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"February 9, 2019",3

After using it for few weeks, I think I enjoy it better and better.First, it doesn’t  do much besides reading and “audible” books. But I think this is where it shines. I tried to read books on my iPhone and iPad before. It’s just hard to concentrate when you have notifications keep showing up. Also, after staring the LED and LCD screens for long enough, my eyes feel dry and tired easily. Kindle only gives you a nice E-ink screen. But it reads great under the light. Not to mention this version has backlight so it helps to adjust the light when you read in dim environment.In addition, I really like the waterproof concept in this versions, as it leaves you less worries when you just put your kindle all around places like I do.And the battery, is amazing. After the first charge when I got it. It last almost 2 weeks.The only minor complain I have is the missing of physical buttons. But you can get around with it overtime.Overall, if you like to read and don’t want to get interrupted, and feel good about your eyes, kindle is a great product for you.",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/RE6L6ILZ1FD6B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"January 31, 2019",3

They had me try a solution that involved a hard reset and charging it again. It seems to have solved the problem of fast battery drainage. I do read a lot so I don't expect my battery to last as long as Amazon says it will, but I also know it was draining too fast for it to be normal. I love Amazon and Kindle CS! They know how to treat customers and I appreciate that they called me to try and fix my problem. Other companies (Sears lol) should take lessons from Amazon. I'm still a little disappointed at the slow wake up with the words ""Waking Up"" before you can swipe to unlock but the CS rep explained to me that it's due to the newer software and actually helps with battery life (when it works properly) and other new features. If you're one who has had trouble with the new 10th Gen Paperwhite battery life, I recommend calling Kindle CS (not just Amazon CS) and letting them know. I changed the star rating from 2 to 5 to reflect the change.Although I didn't jump on the ereader bandwagon early, I've had Kindles since 2011. My first was the Kindle Keyboard (also called K3). We're a KIndle family. Between us we've had the aforementioned K3 the original Kindle Touch, the Basic, and several generations of the Paperwhite. Often we would buy refurbished Kindles and they were just as good as a brand new one. I didn't need a new Kindle as I was happy with my 7th generation Paperwhite. The only reason I bought this one was because of the bluetooth/Audible capability and I liked the idea of no raised bezel. I had been given a gift card and was waiting to use it on something I really wanted and this seemed like the time to upgrade to an exciting new version of the Paperwhite.It's awful. As an ereader it's fine, but it takes longer to wake up (it even says ""waking up) than previous versions, and the battery life is just terrible. At first I left bluetooth on and it ran down very quickly but once I realized I left it on I turned it off. I haven't actually used it yet so other than that one time it's been off since I received the Kindle. I also never turn wifi on except when downloading a book, so wifi is not the issue. Airplane mode stays on. And still the battery life is terrible. This is Kindle #9 (not counting an early version of the Fire) in our household and the first one I've actually been disappointed with.Don't waste your money. If you have a working Kindle stick with it. Maybe the next generation of this one will have fixed the bugs but this one is not at all worth it.",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/RTSM2SZAAB23E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"December 31, 2018",3

I’ve owned 2 previous Nooks as well as used my wife’s older Kindle Paperwhite, and this is the nicest ereader I’ve ever used. I use it daily and think Amazon hit the mark for the most part with this device.Pros:The flush, sealed screen is much higher quality than my Nook. Some of the images make it look like there is glare but I don’t find this to be a major issue. The backlight is also much more even than my Nook. Waterproofing is a nice to have but it probably won’t come in to play for me too often. I do love that audiobook support was added. Some people won’t use it, personally I do, I think it’s a nice feature. If you are going to use it for audiobooks I highly recommend the additional storage model (I have the 32GB - for some reason Amazon put on my review I have the 8). Screen refresh times are better than my Nook as well. All in all I think this device approaches everything that I’d desire in an ereader.Cons:There are 2 major things missing that I don’t personally care much about but I know a lot of people do: immersion reading (simultaneous audio and text) and comfort lighting to reduce blue light at night. Whether you’ll ever get all of these features in the mid grade Kindle is unclear. I would like to think at the least, Amazon might incorporate these into the Oasis in the future. Realistically, they have so much market share I’m not sure they really feel obligated to deliver on every feature.Some people may also miss physical page turn buttons. While I do a little bit, I like the clean look and feel of this device even more. Some people have commented turning pages without the buttons is hard - I have to disagree. Maybe I just have a different definition of “difficult” - I’ve never had an issue.Some complaints about this device got pretty ridiculous - like complaining it didn’t function more like a tablet - but a tablet. As a stand-alone reader, which is what most avid readers are looking for, this device does what it needs to do. Goodreads integration is nice but I don’t want all the social media connectivity and all of that anyways, it’s just a distraction from reading.I know some people have also had issues with pinhole bright spots - hopefully Amazon will replace those units and iron out any production issues, since that would be irritating. Every ereader with a backlight I’ve seen is pretty susceptible to light layer damage so I always recommend a sturdy case, espescially with the flush screen on the new Kindle.All in all, I wholeheartedly recommend this product for anyone who wants a true ereader. I think it’s the best option out there and that’s even more true if you use Audible or Kindle Unlimited.",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/RJOXGIQKQSHBN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"December 30, 2018",3

I tried everything I could think of but could not prolong the battery life. However, no matter what I do, there is no way to make the battery life better than the older generation paperwhite kindle. That Kindle will go to sleep if I fall asleep. This one will NOT. I charged this new one and fell asleep with it on. I woke up with it on the same page and spot. I had previously turned my wifi off as I thought this might preserve the battery. However, just 16 hours after my kindle was fully charged, it was DEAD. So back it went.

That means when I'm washing dishes, it's on its stand getting wet, for instance. So, when I found out that this version was waterproof, I traded in my paperwhite and bought this one. My impression is that functionality wise, it's pretty much the same. I do like how it feels but now that I have a case on it, it doesn't really matter how the machine itself feels :o) I don't expect too much more in terms of functionality because I liked how my old paperwhite worked. So, basically, if you have an old paperwhite and you don't care about the waterproofing (and audible), this version is unnecessary. Speaking of audible, it works fine with a bluetooth headphone. I don't really like audio books but this did get me to try one and it sounds good, audio wise. (the narrator, on the other hand...).I have a few gripes though- one, there is glare in certain situations. It reflects the light. I just have to move it away from the light source and all good. It's definitely not as bad as my phone but it isn't totally glare free.The internal light seems weaker- it may just be me but I keep my light around level 12 and i feel like this level 12 ends up being a bit darker than with my prior paperwhite.And my biggest gripe is that the screen get fingerprints and smudges really easily and quickly. I end up carrying around a microfiber cleaning cloth because it annoys me so much.Overall, I'm happy that I upgraded, all because of the waterproof aspect. But if you have the old version, don't expect it to be a huge upgrade in functionality.Update: I had to send it back for repairs because seriously, the battery life is horrifying. It lasts a day. i have a 1st generation paperwhite and it lasts weeks as promised.

I setup the trade in and it was basically going to be a free upgrade. Glad I did not send the Oasis back too quickly.While the new Paperwhite has some cool features in my opinion it is a huge step backwards from my Oasis (1st Gen). It's much larger, heavier and the display is far inferior. I find it awkward to hold. The lighting is so much better on the Oasis. The large bezel just doesn't belong on a new device in 2019, Amazon really could have done better with this. I found the display lighting to be dull and has a blue tint and highly reflective. I sent it back the day I got it and will continue loving my Oasis. I also have a Voyager, Original Paperwhite and a Touch, all of which I feel are still better than this new device.If you already have a Kindle and are considering upgrading save yourself the time, money and disappointment.

A lot. After wanting to take my Kindle last week on my bike and another day on the bus but didn't because it was raining so much, thought why not invest in one that it didn't matter if a little rain came in contact with it.Compared to the last Paperwhite, Gen 3, it's not a huge difference. Side by side with settings at the same levels, the backlight seems a little better and more evenly distributed on the new Gen 4.The completely flat front of the Gen 4 is nice and annoying. It's easy to switch pages, touch the items on the edge like page/location/etc., and just has a nice feel to it. However, the Gen 3 raised edges do make it easier to not turn the page if your fingers slip a little too close to the edge. The Gen 4 does seem to pick up finger prints a little easier. The ""glare"" is the same as the Gen 3. It's not huge, but noticeable. The texture of the screen is different. The Gen 3 feels more like paper compared to the new one. The Gen 4 screen is more smooth, like a typical tech device.They say this is the slimmest and lightest Paperwhite, not by much. It's just small enough you'll need a new case and honestly who can tell the difference between a few grams.The Gen 4 does respond to touch input faster than previous versions. Makes it easier to leave a review about a book, post to Good Reads, Twitter or Facebook, and make notes.Can't comment about the battery yet as it's just come in. But after reading for a couple hours today, it's gone from 100% to 96% with backlight at 10, wifi on, and bluetooth off.For me it was worth the money at the reduced price (and I would have sent my Gen 2 in for the extra trade in value if it wasn't on another continent) to upgrade only for the waterproof feature and it'll be nice to have an extra Kindle laying around or to leave back in the US when visiting. If you're happy with your Gen 3 and don't need the waterproof or Audible feature, it may not be worth the upgrade. Unless you really need the storage or just love the latest gadgets.For me here's the Pros:- better back light- waterproof- flat front- option for bluetooth if I sign back up for AudibleCons:- flat front makes it a little too easy to change pages- needed a new case- battery will drain faster if bluetooth is left on (but easy to disable if not in use)- I had to spend more money- I have another Kindle laying around the houseLeaving a review on the Amazon US site, purchased on Amazon German site.

Here are the important new features of this model (4th Kindle Paperwhite, released in 2018):-- flush screen (no bezels is a sleek upgrade and the correct design choice, although there is a visible color gradient at the screen's edge)-- water resistant (probably shouldn't read it while scuba diving, but it can withstand a bath tub drop; cool)-- Audible support, but only with Bluetooth headphones (listening to an Audible book demands the entire device's attention, so you're probably better off using the app on your phone anyway)I upgraded from two Paperwhites ago, and the user experience feels mostly the same. I am glad for the 300ppi, which looks beautiful (my previous model had 212, and I could occasionally see pixels).I will say that, although my previous Paperwhite also had the white ""Kindle"" logo at the bottom front, this one feels more distracting. Why have a contrasting color logo in plain view on a reading device? Seems silly and is my only real complaint. I know it's a Kindle without being told at the bottom of every page. I may cover it with black tape, which feels tacky but what can you do.This model also appears to collect more fingerprints, though I'm using mine without a case now, which is probably a factor.I should also note that, confusingly, this model takes longer to wake up if it's been sitting around asleep (maybe 30 minutes or more? I haven't measured). Why is a newer computer slower? Not a pet peeve, just strange.Although I've read about charging and battery issues with this model, mine works perfectly. I typically keep it on airplane mode, which gives me 20-30 hours of reading time. That seems reasonable for an electronic device. Don't worry about negative battery reviews. You will most likely receive a device with a normal battery.If you already have a Kindle Paperwhite, I'd say the upgrade is possibly worth it if you can find a deal and get a decent trade in. It's a tough call.If you don't have an e-reader at all, stop balking and get this model. E-readers are a godsend, and this is your best bet for the next year. I read comics on my iPad and physical books when I receive them as gifts; otherwise, I read on this Kindle. I paid the extra money for no ads because I lead an ad-free life, but I'm told they're not bothersome and sometimes even advertisie great deals. I can't see a reason for mobile Internet connectivity for a dedicated e-reader. WiFi is perfectly fine.Happy reading.",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/R31S5YGJUJCJ8P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"January 3, 2019",2

Thought it was time to upgrade to a newer generation. I really wanted to love this one too, but I really did not like it very much, due to the ads.  The special promotions on the older Kindles were only on the opening page. Now they are everywhere. I could not tell the difference between my books and the books they are promoting. I could not even find my own books without seeing pages of books I don't own. On the second page, it said 'from your lists', but I have no lists and I don't own the books that were previewed. Very confusing.The lighting also isn't great compared to the older model. It's either too bright or too dim. The screen is not any more sensitive than the old one (which I would have liked), it is not lighter and thinner, and if it is, you cannot tell the difference when holding one in each hand. I really thought it would be noticeably thinner and lighter. It is not. I haven't had it long enough to check battery life. My old one went for weeks and weeks, and I had read this generation battery goes longer.I actually considering returning it, as I didn't know if I could deal with the disorganized mass of promotions all over the library pages.  They seem to have deliberately set it up this way, so you accidentally buy books. I had a very difficult time distinguishing  between the books I own and the books being promoted. Too much in your face. I actually liked the promotions on the other Kindle--I occasionally bought the one they promoted on the first page. Take note marketing--one focused book promotion is much more likely to entice you to buy, then pages and pages of book covers and titles.So after I wrote this review, I contacted Amazon chat, and was able to fix the issue with the ads. I was amazed, but now am much happier with it. Also--thanks to Amazon tech support.So the good news is that if the ads really drive you crazy enough to return it, there is a way that it can be corrected with the help of tech support, and also turning off Home Screen View.",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/R2F25DTIM65Q0G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"January 25, 2019",3

Hardly ever used the Fire for anything else (though it still works well), so decided to get the Paperwhite.  Started looking at them in early October, saw that the new version was due out in early November.  Worth the wait; I decided to splurge on the top-of-the-line leather case for it, so had to wait another week until it was available.  Very pleased with the new Paperwhite.  An occasional 2-page skip when advancing to the next page as others have noted, and now and then a quick flash of white on black when changing pages, but these are minor things.  I like the weight of it (only 12 ounces with the case), and it really does seem to be easier on the eyes than the old Fire.  Covers on books in the library are a bit hard to make out sometimes because the images are small and in black and white, but again, a minor thing.

After the new Kindle was released, my old Kindle stopped calculating ""time remaining"" correctly on my books.  Not a big deal, but it is one of my favorite features since I can bargain with myself on how much to read before bed.  This, and a couple other more valid reasons led me to buy the new Kindle since the old one mysteriously disappeared from Amazon.New features:Waterproof!  Cool in theory, but will very rarely be put to use.Bluetooth-enabled for Audible!  Again, cool in theory, but when would one use this?  If I am unable to read, I can just broadcast from my phone or Echo. I can't think of anytime that it would be more convenient to use the Kindle to Bluetooth.More storage!  This may matter in the future, but I mostly use OverDrive Kindle Unlimited right now. I don't forsee my book collection growing to an unmanageable proportion.Extended battery life!  Okay, there is no way to not be blunt here:  This is a straight-up lie!  My last paperwhite, on factory settings with light level less than 10, lasted for weeks at a time.  I literally charged it a few times a year and rarely remembered to turn it all the way off (oops).  This one has been recharged 3 times since December 12th.  So, it doesn't even last a week.Other observations:Eye strain.  I did not have eye strain with the previous Paperwhite, which is why I loved it.  I have serious eye strain with this one.The new Paperwhite is not that much thinner or lighter than the old one.  Not that it needed to be, but it really wasn't worth mentioning in adverts.  Proof, in my opinion, of their sensationalism relating to this product.The new screen is sleeker, but not better.  The old screen really had both a papery look and feel.I'm supremely unhappy with this Paperwhite.  I plan on finding an old used version and returning the new version.  I realize that the added benefits may be useful for some, but they aren't for me, and they especially aren't worth losing the benefits that I did find useful.",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/R19HT8VL5IW67G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"December 26, 2018",3

Factory reset and (if you're lucky!) everything will be good.,5,Verified Purchase,Digital Storage Capacity: 32Offer Type: With Special OffersColor: BlackOption: Without Kindle Unlimited,"I see that many, MANY people are complaining about the battery life of this Paperwhite, which I was also experiencing. I'd downloaded all my books and a few Audible files and the battery was draining at an alarming rate for a few days after.I chatted into Amazon's support yesterday morning and one of the things they'd asked me is if I'd done a factory reset on it. Well, *obviously* I've been using Kindles since the keyboard models and *knew* that wouldn't help...but I went along anyway, just in case.Huh. Insanely, it worked. It's a day later, and after getting all my books downloaded again, my battery is sitting at a comfortable 92% after a few hours of use that night and today at a fairly high brightness and sitting overnight. Without airplane mode being turned on.We'll see if this stays as good or if it's a momentary tease and the device's battery will let me down.Other than that, I'm loving this Paperwhite. I had the Gen 6 version previously, but the waterproofing (which I have not yet tested and really won't go out of my way to!) the Audible compatibility and extra storage (I got the 32 GB model) made this a no-brainer upgrade.The only thing I don't like are the rather bleh newer cases. The previous leather cases felt very nice, and while I haven't yet picked up the leather version for this generation, the fabric case I got feels like a definite downgrade even considering the materials. However, that is NOT a knock against the device itself and I won't drop stars or anything for that decision. It'd be like calling an iPhone amazing except for the Apple-designed cases. Nothing to do with the phone itself.All in all, I'm quite pleased. I'm hoping I won't have to exchange this Paperwhite for anything battery related, but if I do, I do. The Oasis doesn't really interest me, and the regular Kindle doesn't have the light, so the Paperwhite is my sweet spot.

I have been reading my Kindles for approximately 12-14 years and the 10 is awesome! It is about one to two inches shorter that the others, I love the leather cover (very glad I spent the extra $20 to upgrade!), the corners on the cover are rounded to keep them from tearing.  The new Kindle has several changes - I haven't mastered all of them yet, but most are an improvement over the previous Kindles.  The only complaint so far is when you open the book to the front page (where I keep my folders with certain books in them) is not on the first page.  You have to go to the three dots at the top right of the page and go to ""Your Library"" (at least it's the first item on the list) to get to the folders you have set up.  I liked being able to open ""Home"" and have my folders right there.  If there is a way around this, I haven't found it, and nobody at Kindle has been able to help me change it to be like I want it.  Other than that small item (which probably won't bother most people), I would highly recommend getting the new 10.  I also didn't realize you can get a car charger ($66 from Amazon, but I found one on Amazon from another individual - which was brand new for $9.99 - HUGE difference in price!)  The plug from your old Kindle works just fine with the new 10 Kindle - if  you don't purchase the bundle, you don't need a new one.  I don't like that you cannot purchase a bundle where  you don't need WiFi...in order to upgrade and purchase items separately, it would have raised the price by $133 - a bit pricy I think.  I would have liked to have the one that doesn't need WiFi, but settled for the one that needs WiFi and will keep plenty of books downloaded in my folders so when we are traveling, I don't need to use WiFi.  I think the difference in price of the Kindle (wifi vs no wifi) should be the amount to upgrade to a bundle with one that doesn't need wifi).  But for $133, I just couldn't justify or afford the no wifi version.  Great book and it's a lot lighter (just a few grams in weight, but noticeable, since the book is smaller and fits easier into my purse.  I would have given it a 5 star rating, but there are a few things that I didn't like (mentioned above).",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/R3ATCR400EXD4I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"February 6, 2019",2

Most of the obvious differences between the two are minor.  The flush bezels are a nice touch, although you do lose the feedback about how close your finger is to the edge of the screen.  The new one is faster, smoother operating and doesn't hang, but it's also 6 years younger.  The new display is a little better matte which should make it easier to read around lights, but I never had any complaints with the old surface.  Character display looks a little improved - the advertise better resolution and there may be better contrast under the same lighting conditions.  I like the new hardware, particularly the waterproof claim, since I used to have to use a ziplock when I got near water.There have been several improvements in the Paperwhite software over the years that look like they may be useful, but it will take a while to explore them all.My only real complaint is battery life.  I typically read several hours per day, background light on around 10, connected to a nearby 5GHz wifi.  Under these conditions, I am not sure I can achieve a full week without recharging.  The biggest drain on these devices always seems to be wifi - on my last one if I turned wifi off I could reliably achieve a couple weeks.  Bigger batteries are heavier, so I won't say that Amazon has made the wrong trade-off.

I'd like to point out that these are not advertisements for authors Clive, Cussler, Sandford, King, Follett etc.  Instead, expect an illustration for freakish circus clowns, or my favorite... a Japanese Anime school girl in somewhat undersized clothing.  Maybe ok if you are a 14 year old girl, but if you are a 57 year old dude with grey hair you get interesting looks on the plane.I can't help but wonder if this is somewhat done on purpose, and how many of us buy the ""advertisement free"" upgrade shortly after purchasing the Kindle and having it pop up advertising for material that doesn't match our reading genre at all.  It is so badly out of sync with what I read, that it seems contrived.My other complaint is that this e-reader does not have a means to directly connect to overdrive.  If you use overdrive, you have to log into overdrive, navigate to your local library, and select and download your books to Amazon first.  WTH?  This likewise has to be by design.  They purposefully make it more difficult to borrow books than to purchase them.On the plus side... my Kindle does not have any noticeable missing pixels or bright spots.

I swore at that point to never overspend on a Kindle again.  I caught this sale at $99.99 for the newest Paperwhite and bought one.First, the bad.  At this point, I do not understand Amazons thinking.  By now, you would think they could come up with a better backing for their readers other than the fingerprint and oil from your skin magnet.  This is an issue for anyone who prefers to hold the device in hand.  If you use a book-styled cover?  This is irrelevant.  Secondly, for those who choose the non-ad version.... they use the same old boring screensavers as they have for years!!  Why not have the actual book cover that you are reading for a screensaver?  This is why at this point?  Stick to the less expensive, ad version.  At least you get variety and along with that, some good offers.Now, for the performance.  Looking at this in the front - it resembles the Voyage very closely.  Holding it in hand for me is great.  The display is sharp and the page turning is quicker than the Voyage.  Now, I also own the last generation of Paperwhite.  I chose this latest due to its low price, its flush bezel like Voyage) and its audible feature.This is an e-reader that offers substance over style.

The Paperwhite 4 is pretty much the Oasis 2 minus the larger screen (which was never a plus for me since the device no longer fit into large pockets) and the adaptive brightness (which is a really unneeded feature and likely drains the battery faster).A lot of people keep saying their battery life is terrible.

This difference seems to be from the light because at lowest brightness (the lights are still on) the difference is not as pronounced.The frontlighting appears even to my eyes, no hotspots. My first 2013 unit, I had definite hotspots bad enough to show in photos, and near the middle of the display, the second 2013 unit, which is the one I have now, still has mild hotspots along the bottom of the display, but this 2018 unit has even more even lighting.After updating to the latest software on each and opening up King in Yellow and setting both to the smallest and least bold Bookerly font, the 2018 seems a bit finer but still crisp and easier to read than the 2013, and setting the 2018 to the next bolder setting makes it a bit bolder than the 2013. The 2013 is still very readable but I'd say the 2018 is easier to look at, and flipping the screens upside down so the words are not distracting, the assessment remains. Again though, if I didn't have a side-by-side comparison, I wouldn't have noticed. Grayscale images have noticeably higher contrast on the 2018, although I don't have much use for that.I can't say anything about the battery life yet, I give eink readers about a week after loading books before full charge and giving the battery a go, and my Kindle from gen 1, gen 3, gen 6 all had battery lives as expected. Responsiveness seems fine.The size is close enough I can reuse my 2013 Paperwhite's folio case and TPU fitted back cover (not at the same time), which is good because I haven't seen any TPU back-only covers (I use mine with generic popsocket). There is a little bit more slop in the case, particularly around the bottom port and button, but the covers stay on and the charging port and button is still accessible. I have to read around if the usb port is waterproof like the rest of the unit without a port cover.Specs are one thing, but it really does *feel* substantially lighter and thinner in my hand vs. the 2013. I wouldn't notice if I hadn't had one to compare but it should help a lot in my hours-long reading sessions.Assuming the battery performs up to snuff I'm happy with paying $57 to get waterproofing and a new battery after 5 years on the 2013, and the flat front, smaller size, less weight are nice bonuses ($57 after the $100 December 2018 promotion, $25 trade in value on my 2013, and the additional 25% off with trade in offer). My time between upgrades are definitely getting longer though, so I can understand if people with Kindles less than 5 years old skip this one, even if Amazon stopped doing trade up deals like this one.Anybody who doesn't have an eink reader yet, unless you read more than 2 hours a sitting and 4 hours a week, I think the cost of a new one is still better spent towards getting a better smartphone or a separate tablet, or printed books. E-ink readers are going to have to get a lot better on pricing or features if they are going to be more than devices for avid text and manga readers looking to ditch the space-weight requirements of physical books. $100 still seems like a lot if you already have a smartphone, and laptop (or tablet and desktop)--and this is coming from someone who early adopted the $400 Kindle 1st gen when it first came out 10 years ago, and upgraded to 3rd gen, 6th gen, and now the 10th gen (hmm at this rate I may not be upgrading until 15th gen). (Granted, the 2015 Paperwhite did sell for $80 a couple weeks ago new, and used units can also be cheaper).It is a workhorse, a fairly specialized tool, and maybe that's enough, but since there aren't that many manufacturers in this market, I do worry that eink may disappear before other technologies can advance enough to take over eink's advantage in reading comfort and battery life.",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/R2WXZHF5RCEFQN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"December 13, 2018",2

I was excited, because the book was one that could only be found as a Kindle version--the paper/hardcover no longer appears to exist. Unfortunately, it includes charts and photos, and I found there was no way to enlarge either. Even with a strong magnifying glass I could not read the print on the charts, and the photos were barely more than blobs. This made much of the book unusable for me.I posted a 2-star review, and almost immediately I got a call from Amazon's Customer Service. Not to ask me not to post a 2-star review but, rather, to tell me there was a fix that I had not been able to find online, and could they help?Apparently in earlier versions of the Paperwhite there was a setting in the ""accessibility"" area that addressed this issue, but you had to turn it on. With the NEW Paperwhite, it's a default feature! But because of this, I was not aware it existed (wasn't mentioned in the accessibility area, where I  HAD looked,  nor the tutorials--or if it were I missed it). TA DA! It works!!!All you have to do is TRIPLE-TAP on a picture or chart (not double, but triple--who knew??) and it leaps out of the page as its own page. From there, you can even finger-stretch it! Voila! I can read all the little letters!!I am now very satisfied and perfectly happy to give the New Paperwhite a 5-star review. And thanks again to Amazon for having such wonderful people to help us. I think I should have known there had to be a fix, because Amazon has never let me down yet, and I've been a loyal customer for many years.

I have been a long-time Kindle user, love them, and have had previous generations of Paperwhites with good experience. I decided to replace my current Paperwhite with a 10th generation model because of some small issues with my current one. However, on the first 10th Gen paperwhite, I found that the text contrast flickered every time I turned a page. It would show as dark black for a second, then immediately change to gray. This happened no matter how I set the screen brightness, which font I selected, or which book I opened. Setting the font to ""bold"" still resulted in the text darkness showing first as black then flicking to a lighter darkness.  That flicker drove me nuts and made reading really unpleasant.So, I called Amazon, went through the steps of rebooting, resetting, etc (which I had done on my own to no avail), and they said they would immediately send a replacement. But the replacement, another brand new 10th Generation Paperwhite, does the exact same thing. Every page shows that change in contrast after a second which is annoying and distracting.Amazon support people on the phone have no explanation for this.

Okay fine.  Nothing is perfect right?  So I decide to push on.  The device seemed to work properly and I was off reading like a mad man.Then a week in, I notice the device goes from 80% charge to completely drained with wifi turned off and in sleep mode. What? Seriously? A brand new release and the device can't hold a charge?  I put my negativity aside and contacted Amazon support.  They helped me troubleshoot the problem which ended in getting a new cable (one that actually plugs into the device without forcing it) and also how to properly restart it.  Followed all the instructions and really hoped I was on my way to a 5-star review.But alas, it was not meant to be.  The battery drain has continued well past 5 restarts and the device simply will not hold a charge. Now I know why Jeff Bezos is so rich - selling devices that aren't ready for prime time (Amazon Prime time, haha) to millions of people.  This device is simply not made properly. You should not have to troubleshoot a brand new device as if it's 10 years old and starting to fail.  Never mind the fact that page turning has a distinctive lag. I mean, come on. Its sole purpose is to view text. Text!  But Amazon couldn't be bothered to put any kind of decent processor in the thing that would make page turning instant and crisp.One last attempt to resolve with Amazon support and these were the options I was given:1. Receive a 15% discount on a new device AND NOT be able to return the faulty device!  I literally laughed when I was told this.  How does that resolve my problem?  Unless my problem is a bizarre need to give Jeff Bezos more of my money for nothing in return.2. Return the device for a full refund - um, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't that Amazon's regular return policy?  The whole point is I want a Kindle to read with.

As technology advances, these devices should get better. Not so with this new Kindle Paperwhite (waterproof). I have had two earlier versions of the Kindle (I don’t know what model, about 7-10 years ago), a Voyager that I left in a hotel room,  an Amazon Fire 7”, and this new Paperwhite that I sent back after 4 days. I had another Kindle just before this one that was worse, that I traded in. I have had two problems: 1) I can stand 3 feet from my router and the Kindle will say, “No WiFi signal.” That happened with this new one and the last one I sent back to trade in for this one; 2) Battery drains from full to %14-17 overnight. This is with it being in airplane mode (I read the other reviews) and the device being OFF.Maybe there is some kind of trick to get the battery to last longer, but why should I have to figure it out? They tout it as having a battery lasting for weeks. Bull hockey. It doesn’t last overnight! The older ones had a better battery life. I am going to research and figured out which one I had before and get a used one. This one is a piece of crap. The Amazon Fire has better battery life, and it’s not that good. I may go back to the Voyager. I don’t remember having problems with that one.OH, I called customer service also. Simone couldn’t care less about the problem.

She said the system won’t apply that again to my return.So, I was induced to upgrade by a %25 discount and $25.00 toward my trade-in. Now they won’t extend the %25 back to my next purchase when I return this one after 4 days. I feel like they should have offered the %25 to me again. I say don’t buy this new junk.

I love flat screen and the adaptable brightness. And as this is my 3rd kindle, I'm sold on the Kindle E-readers.I'm just not quite sure I love this kindle paperwhite. But it maybe because I ""downgraded"" from the Kindle Voyage. My Voyage battery was dying and would only hold a charge for 2-3 hours between charges. I didnt like needing be plugged into the wall to read, and one of my absolute favorite aspects of the Kindle is the battery life for this ""tablet."" It would last weeks, no less than 2.5 weeks with daily reading of a minimum of 2 hours, and even continuous days of 10+ hours reading. And my Voyage battery would still last at least 2weeks.With the new Paperwhite releasing at the same time as my Voyage dying I decided it would be worth the purchase.I've had my paperwhite for 3 months now and I'm a little disappointed. My battery life with 2-3 hour nightly reading (wifi, bluetooth off, brightness set at 9-10) only lasts me about 6 days, and then it needs to charge.The power button, and it's a button not a slider, sits exactly where my pinky finger holds up the device, which I know is a picky picky thing, but the first month of using the device I consistently shut off the device while reading. And because the on/off button is an actual button if you prop up the device (no cover) on a hard surface you will often shut off the device.I often find that the touch screen callaboration is finicky, and opening the Kindle Store often results in freezing and slow other functions.The ""Synch my Kindle"" option in use with high speed internet often doesn't bring new bought books from computer or pre-ordered books to my home screen or not downloaded library. Making the need to search for that new book.Whisper-synching between devices, such as from Kindle app on Smart phone to Kindle works about 10% of the time, even when both devices are in the same room connected to the same wifi network.As I said maybe I'm a little harsher as I LOVED LOVED LOVED my kindle voyage. But I guess I was hoping with the new design and ""upgrades"" of the kindle paperwhite it would be on par with the first edition Kindle Voyage with the perks of being waterproof.Overall, I still get to have all my favorite books with me on one device that isn't and actual tablet. I just need to charge it at least once a week, maybe even twice if I'm on reading binge.",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/R202TBGDDLE4FD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"February 12, 2019",2

Amazon Customer,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGJZ3H7W7WZUMTLQ6LVFQ56IVCSA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,Not so great if you are left handed and want a cover,2,Verified Purchase,Digital Storage Capacity: 8Offer Type: With Special OffersColor: BlackOption: Without Kindle Unlimited,"I have pretty big hands and with the cover folded back I like to hold my kindle with a finger between the cover and the kindle so I have a better grip. You can't do that left handed. If you reverse the cover (so it opens to the right) you can do it but you lose the automatic power off/ startup.Also, you can't switch page turning areas on the screen so it feels much less natural holding in your left hand. Clearly it is designed for right handed people and if I was right handed it would be a really nice device. But I'm not. Lack of equal accessibility = poor engineering. Bad on Amazon... If you are left handed you may want to look at other options. Sad... Edit- I got a nice surprise call from customer support. We had a good discussion about usage and handedness. There is no current solution to the poor engineering (my words not theirs) but at least the person understands the issue.  In short- technology should adapt to people. People shouldn't have to adapt to the technology. Technology (or non-tech products) should be able to accommodate something as common as being left handed. Can you use it left handed? Yes but uncomfortably. Does it feel as natural as holding it in your right hand? No, or at least no, not the way I hold it.Edit edit- Thanks Amazon for putting this on sale a couple of weeks after black Friday and cyber Monday when most items are discounted.

Edishop,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEZQ46QXOFRVI7H6JCQGQGIOX7JA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,Not As Good As I Hoped,2,Verified Purchase,Digital Storage Capacity: 8Offer Type: Without Special OffersColor: BlackOption: Without Kindle Unlimited,"I purchased this Kindle to replace my fifth generation version, because of a few features that I really wanted. After 6 months of use, here's the good and bad I've discovered to date.The Good:Backlight feature. A main reason why I upgraded from my old Kindle, was the backlight. I really appreciate that now I can read in low light settings (hello airplanes and while in bed). It's the main reason why I upgraded my Kindle, because trying to read a Kindle with a booklight just got annoying over the years. Now I don't need the light anymore.Book covers on the home screen. Viewing book covers on the home screen was a delightful surprise. I know how much work goes into every feature of developing a book, including the cover design, and it's fun to see some of the amazing work that's been done. It also makes shifting through what books and samples I have to read easier to manage than with my old Kindle where it was just a page after page of a list of titles. Now I feel more like I'm browsing in a bookstore, which I've always loved to do.Waterproof. I don't plan to drop this thing in the tub, but I do associate being waterproof with being a bit durable. Only time will tell if this will be true or not.The BadBattery life. My number one complaint with my new Kindle is the awful battery life. Even when the back light and wifi settings are turned off, I can barely get a day out of this thing before it dies. I'm shocked because my fifth generation Kindle used to last for a week before needing a re-charge and I expected a newer version to last longer, not shorter. I can't imagine this thing lasting on a long plane ride.Forced into Goodreads services with one touch.  I shy away from all things social media as much as I can, and just about had a nervous breakdown when after one touch of the finger a Goodreads account was AUTOMATICALLY created for me.  Then I had to run around trying to figure out how to get RID of the Goodreads account I never wanted.Look I get it, some people adore social media and don't mind having their name and habits broadcasted for all the world to see. BUT, that's only some people, not ALL people. Plus, while I find reviews are important and I try to be diligent to write them for anything I have tried, I do not want my habits broadcasted for the world to see. What I'm reading and when is my business, not others. While I was eventually able to close the Goodreads account, I should not have had to run around trying to opt out, I should have been asked if I wanted to opt in, not be forced into it.  Even worse, I still haven't figure out a way to remove the Goodreads option from the home screen, so I try to be very mindful that I do NOT want to touch that thing again.Page turning. The touch screen option is fine, but you can only go forward when touching the right side of the screen which means you can only do so with your right hand.  With my old Kindle which hand didn't matter I could turn the page with either, but now I constantly have to readjust when I want to turn the page. It's also annoying that sometimes my finger brushes the page and it will turn. That touch screen is sensitive!Ads, Ads, Ads. I purchased the ad free version, but the default home screen is so buy with recommendations, and what's new, etc, that I felt like I was dealing with ads anyway. I couldn't even find my purchased books at first! Thankfully you can turn off all of the noise and now I have a clean menu with only the books I am reading, but it was a bit of work to clean everything up.Overall, I don't think this new Kindle is bad, as it does have some nice features (yay backlight and book covers), but the few things I've run into that are bad, for me are really bad (battery, auto sign-up to Goodreads) and why the rating is not higher.",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/R1MO5JXWGWY8V3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"March 11, 2019",One

I bought this as a gift for my grandson, so he could read along with the text  while Audible is reading it to him.  But, unlike the Kindle App on android and iPhones, where the text being read is highlighted while Audible is reading it, this device only seems to allow one or the other.  You can either read the text on the virtual page, or listen to the narration, while looking at a fixed screen showing only the audio controls.  Why would Amazon limit this latest and ""greatest"" version when their Kindle App allows this?  The reason i bought the dedicated Kindle Paperwhite was so that the child could enjoy the book without the distraction of all the other apps that are on his iPhone.  This device will have to go back.UPDATE:Still disappointed, but I'm adding 1 star for the simple reason that within a few hours of my origin review, a very sincere Amazon customer service associate called to see if he could help make it right, or assist in the return.  He confirmed the limitation that I reported and said he also didn't understand why this dedicated Kindle would not have the same capabilities as the kindle app for Android and iPhones.  He reported he would submit the concern to the kindle development engineers and hopefully they would upgrade the software with equivalent capabilities in the future.  So my message to the Amazon IT engineers is:  Consider ALL your potential users and ALL the possible ways they might use your products.  This device is prefect for a young student to help develop their love of reading while also developing their reading skills.  I have decided to keep it and hope that it gets used for its intended purpose.

The Paperwhite is slightly smaller than the Touch and so light! I can easily keep it in my purse. The leather cover I purchased for it looks great and gives me a subtle ""holding a real book"" feel. I love the adjustable screen brightness and more fonts to choose from (though not all of them work in every book).

First, it was a bundle meant to include 6 months free subscription to the Kindle library. Problem was after purchase there was no way to claim it. In fairness to Amazon they did give me credit for it. Second issue the device and charging cable did not match. Third problem the screen would display at times like an etch-o-sketch that was being erased. If you are not familiar with the device not to worry just younger than me. Fourth issue, the device would freeze.Amazon shipped a second device that had three main issues. First, the screen would often  flicker when changing pages. Second, part of the screen had damaged pixels the size of a four characters when reading a page from a book. Third the device would freeze.I was also surprised to find that the replacement device 's charging port accommodated the original power cable. To me this implies there is a problem with the manufacturing process of the devices rather than cable. In my opinion a very poor omen.Customer Service did offer to send me a third device but given the multiple issues associated with both devices can only surmise now is not the time to purchase a Paperwhite. Also curious how I could not find the processor running the device, neither could anyone from Kindle technical support?In fairness to Amazon as always they resolved any legitimate issues I had and refunded my money in full. The only difference this time is the process took much longer. Many of the overseas customer service representatives had a limited comprehension of the English language. Albeit they were very polite. Several mentioned they were from Asia but in truth I personally do not mind which country representatives are from so long as they can understand the English language.In my day when selecting an outsourcing company or hiring a person for a customer facing position comprehension of the language spoken by my customer base was of paramount importance.

They were extremely helpful and professional. We reset my kindle and updated the software. That seemed to do the trick! The battery is behaving perfectly. I’m so happy to have my kindle back.... (if anyone is having battery issues try resetting it! It really works!)  So I ordered a new paper white first of January. Less than 24 hours after I had it it wouldn’t keep a charge. Literally delivered at 2 pm on Saturday and by Sunday mid morning it wouldn’t hold a charge. So it took about an hour with amazon chat to get a replacement sent. They kept wanting to just try a different charger. But because it was so brand new I insisted on a replacement because I knew it wasn’t the charger. Well I’ve had this replacement since then and it’s been fine. The battery isn’t as good as my 3rd edition but still I could live with it. Well now I can’t even finish a book without the battery going dead! Charged it Friday night and read two hours. Saturday morning it was at 12%. So I charged it Saturday morning and read for maybe three hours and when I went back to finish my book that night the battery was dead again. So I charged it this morning. Guess what? The battery is dead at 9:30 pm. After being fully charged this morning and I didn’t even read on it. I’m. So. Frustrated. No WiFi on and the lighting is down lower than I like just to conserve the battery. I’m not even sure I want a replacement at this point.

I have had 2 Kindle Fires and I loved them both.  I (reluctantly) gave my first one away to a friend after using it for several years because it seemed to need charging more often so I bought a newer version.  After using it for a while, it became apparent that the Kindle Fire just didn't have a very powerful battery since the brand new one didn't seem to hold a charge any longer than the one I had given away.  So then I started researching the new Paper White and was overwhelmed with the user reviews, especially on battery life and the actual reading experience so I bought it.  Upon receiving it, I was impressed with the size and quality, but the more I used it, the less I liked it.  The screen is quite a bit smaller than the Kindle Fire, but I don't think that's the main reason for my disappointment since I frequently read on my phone and enjoy it on a much smaller screen.  I also read a lot on my 10"" tablet while I ride a stationery bike at the gym and really like it.  The problem seems to be more subtle, but the best way I can describe it is that it took one of the things I really enjoy (reading) and turned it into a job.

I like to read to relax and I certainly don’t like having to deal with all of the changes and looking up how to do a font change and how difficult it is to download books from one kindle to the other etc. I actually went back to using my original paperwhite and had this is not been a gift I would have sent it back!,B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/R211EYX1172145/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"January 25, 2019",3

Personally, after using it for a few weeks now, I still haven't had to charge it since the first time I did. The set up was relatively fast. I did have an issue where the book covers for the ebooks didn't show up but after about 2 hours it was fine.It does take time to fully integrate! For mine, it was about 2 hours with a consistent internet connection. Some ppl might be less or more, but I was able to have everything there fairly quickly.The only real downside I can find is that there seems to be a slight lag when pressing on the touchscreen. I imagine it's a processing thing with the operating system where it isn't as sophisticated as other tablets but it's not a big deal.The screen is really what I bought for it. It is a LOT easier on my eyes than any other tablet I've used for my ebooks. It makes reading for hours a lot better so it's nice to not have the eye strain.A lot of people mentioned the ads, they only show up in the ""Recommended"" and when the screen first opens up. Besides that, its no big deal. I can read for hours without any type of ad bothering me if that is a concern. You will only see the ads when you start it up and on the home screen.So I guess my only complaint is the slight lag I see when I press on the touchscreen. I imagined something a little better for price I paid for it, but it works and it doesn't freeze up. IT just needs a few seconds.I would still recommend this to anyone looking for a better eReader.

Keri,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AG2HXZP6MQYCOJK45FXF7OX2TB2A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,works okay after 3 weeks. i miss my kindle keyboard buttons.,4,Verified Purchase,Digital Storage Capacity: 8Offer Type: With Special OffersColor: BlackOption: Without Kindle Unlimited,"My Kindle Keyboard broke the first weekend in November, after 8 years of use. Sometimes heavy use, but a lot of time spent on my nightstand, because honestly I prefer regular books to ebooks - but not having the e-ink reading option if I wanted it was irritating, so with a little research, I bought the new Paperwhite.After 3 weeks, it works fine. I like that unlike the previous versions of the Paperwhite, I can turn the backlight off completely, which may not make much of a difference to battery life, but makes me feel better about it. I also like the size - not having the keyboard buttons at the bottom makes the device a little more convenient.I don't like not having actual buttons to press to turn pages. I've had a difficult time with my taps not registering or overregistering, and the left-turn space is way too small. The thing desperately needs discrete buttons on each side to improve the page-turn experience. Also, I'm constantly turning pages instead of accessing the top menu, which is frustrating, and even though the page-location slider is at the bottom, I have to tap at the top to get it to open, which is not intuitive at all. (More pages turned unexpectedly!)But these are all complaints about a button-free experience, and I simply can't afford an Oasis device to get my buttons back. I've thought about looking for a gently used Keyboard elsewhere, or seeing if someone can repair mine, but I do really like the soft backlight when i'm reading at night - I set it to 3 or 4 - and I like the smooth screen. The lack of corners means when I'm inevitably eating croissants or the like, I don't end up with little crumbs crushed into the crevices.The back of the device is a soft-texture plastic which picks up finger-grease like nothing I've ever seen. Within ten minutes of opening it up and turning it on, even though my hands were clean and dry, it was kind of gross looking. I immediately went to buy a case for it.I don't like that I can't turn the device off completely. The best I can do is remember to turn on Airplane Mode, then turn the screen off. This caused problems with turning pages and memory after about 2 weeks and loading in my library, where the device hung or stuttered and I had to force a restart. It would be nice if I could simply shut the thing off when I'm not going to be reading for a while, and not have to worry about those restarts.It's also a bit frustrating that the USB connector is still the old version, not a USB-C, which most of my other devices have switched to. I had been looking forward to being able to reduce the number of cables I keep around for charging.So I guess on the whole, I dislike the Paperwhite because it isn't a Keyboard, and because I have always been mistrustful of/had bad experiences with touch-only input, but I've found myself liking the new features more than I expected. I'm certainly glad I paid a little extra for the 2018 model instead of a refurbished/dead stock of the previous version, or the regular Kindle.

I upgraded to have a waterproof version and to invert black and white.

I’ve had it six weeks, my usesge hasn’t changed. I have the Bluetooth off, wireless off, I even paid to remove ads. It was at 100% yesterday morning at 10:45. At 10pm it was at 6%.

We did a hard re-set. The battery problem only lasted a few days and then it went back to 7-9 days I was getting before the weird glitchy weekend. It’s possible my case wasn’t properly ‘sleeping’ the device, though why it would only be for two days, after six weeks of working fine, is a mystery. I also spent the $20 to remove the ‘special offers’, which I think was also helpful as it was less processing it had to do when I opened up. So, battery life is back to this version’s normal, which could definitely be improved. I don’t know if the lack of bevel (which is nice) and waterproof (nice) and invert black-and-White (nice) are worth the upgrade and reduced battery life.

The page with the list of your collections/ebooks is now “your library.” The new homepage is not totally in-your-face marketing, but about two-thirds of it is.The three book covers in the upper left corner are the three ebooks you have opened most recently. Just click on the cover to open the ebook.“Your reading lists” are books (ebooks and print) you put on some type of list at Amazon. You can remove the books, but I spent way too much time deleting books I looked at 15 years ago or longer.The row at the bottom is the start of rows of books Amazon’s analytics has selected for marketing to you, etc.I always pay extra to get a Kindle without special offers so I don’t know what the special offers page looks like.Navigating Your Library: To move from page to page in your list of collections or your list of books in your library/in a collection, I recommend swiping your finger up to go to the next page and down to go to the previous page. If you swipe your finger to the left or right (like you do within an ebook and like I used to do within a collection), the Kindle may slow you down while you wait for it to download ebooks from the cloud. I spent too much time on the telephone with a customer-service executive to learn this. He didn’t understand what I meant when I said I needed to go from page to page within a collection.The ebooks which are not in a collection are not listed after your collections. Ignore that statement in the user’s guide. (I don’t have a clue which one of the Paperwhite user guides is the correct one for the waterproof Kindle Paperwhite. The only one I can get to using my waterproof Kindle is the 4th edition, and I have editions 2 through 12 on my other Kindle Paperwhite.)Slowness and Variable Sensitivity: I don’t know what to do about the device’s slowness in waking up or its variability in sensitivity to touch.Cover: I recommend not getting the “All-new Kindle Paperwhite Water-Safe Fabric Cover (10th Generation-2018).” It makes it awkward to open and close the Kindle and easy to accidentally touch the on/off button. According to some other customers, the fabric frays. (Wish I had read that before I purchased mine.)Wondering why I kept the waterproof Kindle Paperwhite?

I got a refurbished Kindle Paperwhite (7th Generation) & it had a little light leak in it, so I took it back and upgraded to this one. I was pretty sad giving that the older Kindle up, but I was also anxious to get this new one, with audible.This one is lighter with a sleeker screen. I do miss the slightly textured screen of the older paperwhite; there was something nostalgic and book like with that. This one feels more like a mini tablet, but it's smooth and responsive, and even more sensitive than my older paperwhite, almost too sensitive. But I like it and I am getting use to it.The device can get real fingerprinty, but you only see it on the black part of the Kindle, it not a big deal. I love it though, and it's really easy on the eyes. I love how I can increase the text, highlight, save notes, look up words with the touch of a finger.I was slightly disappointed there was no speaker on it for the Audible, but maybe that would have made it a bulkier device. It's not a deal breaker though; if anything this is a game changer.I love everything about it that those minor issues don't outweigh the bigger picture. This kindle is a waterproof book, and you can carry your whole library of books around with you anywhere. You can read on it beautifully without the glare of the sun or bulky book light.

I'd like to just give my viewpoint as someone who hasn't used an e-reader since the first Nook.1. This Kindle is very light and as someone with big hands, I can easily hold this device one handed without a lot of fatigue.2. The included Bluetooth for wireless headphones for audio books is nice. I'm not usually one for audio books but that's not to say I won't try them.3. I don't notice any issues with the backlight. It's far better than the nook which doesn't have one and beats an add-on spotlight style book light.4. Battery life has been sufficient when I turn on airplane mode which is easy with the top control panel.5. The water resistance is nice because I frequently leave this on the kitchen counter and I'm clumsy so spilled liquid is inevitable.I only have three complaints:1. Finding ebooks on the device itself is tedious with the slow eink touch screen and Amazon's Kindle store isn't well organized.2. The screen size is about 1"" too small for what I feel would be a more comfortable compact reading display. It's not hard to read but you end up turning a lot more pages which interrupts the flow.3.

So I was looking forward to upgrading to this version since it’s waterproof and it has compatibility with audiobooks. However, I can not recommend the product for people like me who mainly read at nighttime or in the dark. More below.MY USAGE CONTEXTI’m a light sleeper. For years I would get up at night and watch TV or use my cell phone. Then I learned about how bad that can be - it is for me - and a doctor recommended reading instead of watching TV. But I did not want to turn the lights on to read, as it would definitely wake my body up even more and wake my wife who was sleeping soundly. So eventually I stumbled upon a kindle reader and that changed my life. I could now read in bed without turning on the lights and it would help me fall back asleep pretty quickly.So given that context, here’s why I don’t recommend this kindle for night reading.IT HAS TO “WAKE UP”This one was surprising to me. This new kindle actually needs to “wake up” much like a computer. It takes about 2-3 seconds for it to do so. It’s a nitpick, but my previous models did not do this.WHEN IT “WAKES UP”, IT USES THE MAXIMUM BACKLIGHTThis is my real issue with the “waking up”. No matter what level you had last left the backlight on, when it wakes up it shines extremely bright for those 2-3 seconds. It actually causes me serious discomfort b/c I’m in a very dark environment (remember my context) and this bright light just blasts on. I also lights up the room you are in, like a cell phone flashlight. So if anyone else is in the room they will notice the light.IT IS A WHITE BACKLIGHTMy previous kindles had a blueish backlight. That was a lot easier on my eyes. This one has a white backlight.THE BACKLIGHT IS TOO BRIGHTNot sure if it’s b/c of the white tone backlight, but this kindle is way too bright. I have the backlight set to 1 - the lowest it goes before turning off - and it still lights up my room like a weak flashlight. I can’t read it in the typical darkness of night b/c it causes me so much eye strain.So those are the reasons that I will return this kindle and looked for an older model. If you are going to use this kindle outdoors and in a pool or beach scenario, then this may be the one for you. If you are a night reader like me, stay away from this model and look for one of the models with a blue backlight.",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/RXEGFDTMJTNKG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"March 3, 2019",One

SpartanED,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGEODNWBIWQSRLTVCYOCZ7PZM7GA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,Questionable design choices; lacking features of competitors,3,Verified Purchase,Digital Storage Capacity: 8Offer Type: With Special OffersColor: BlackOption: Without Kindle Unlimited,"I'll be honest. The main reason why I bought this is because I really wanted an ebook reader with a backlit display, and this one is discounted for students. First off, these are first impressions and have not been using it long-term. I already noticed missing features and questionable design choices, but relented because I really wanted an ebook reader at a bargain.The first thing that struck me about this reader, is that it is surprisingly thin and light. The words are crisp, and I noticed a uniform light distribution throughout the display. I did not notice any pinholes or the like that some others have noticed. The backing of the device is a comfortable, soft-touch finish. I enjoy that. The 8GB is enough for most people, unless you're heavy into graphic novels and PDFs, the Wi-Fi only model will suit just about everybody, and the Special Offers is unobtrusive and therefore is fine to have (it only shows an ad on the lock screen and can be disabled at a later date). The main competitors to this device are the Nook GlowLight and the Kobo Clara HD/Aura 2.Now that the overview is over, here are some pros and cons:PROS:-Crisp, clear display-Even light-distribution-Soft-touch backing-Water-Resistant-Thin and light-Integration with Goodreads-Invert display makes for great nighttime reading-Great reading assistance (dictionary, flashcards, X-Ray, etc)-(This one is a game-changer). The Kindle and Audible store is AMAZING to have because I already use both services on other devices. I like how there are free books if you have a Prime account, and the Kindle Unlimited subscription is not too bad. For me, this separates it from other services.CONS:-Why is the power button on the bottom of the device? At least allow the user to change the orientation of the display instead of just portrait and landscape. This is easy to depress when you set the Kindle and prop it up. I don't see any reason for this.-Micro-USB and NOT a Type-C connector for charging. For a 2018 Kindle, just about every device has transitioned to Type-C and is disappointing to not see it here. I thought I would finally be able to use one connector for all my devices,  but not here.-The LED lights do NOT allow the user to change the color-temperature. This is one of the BIGGEST drawbacks. Just about all the competitors allow users to change the light to be warmer, which is a lot easier on the eyes. Right now the light is too white and blue (cool temperature) and is very disappointing to not be allowed to make it warmer.-The LED does not have ambient light auto-adjust. This is ridiculous. Not having the light to adjust in intensity when you move to different environments kills the experience to me because I have to keep manually adjusting it.-The above adjustment may not be so bad if it is simple to adjust the backlight and other font settings. Unfortunately, the current software forces you to first tap the top of your screen, THEN tap Settings, THEN be able to adjust brightness (changing the font goes another step further than this). Ok I am nitpicking here, but it is super annoying if you want to change the light quickly because it is not a one-step process.Overall:I really like this device. I enjoy the reading experience and I got it at a good price-point. Amazon has always been good to me, but they really made some questionable decisions. I can do without Bluetooth, Audible, water-resistance, and other things if they would simply allow better color temperature options, auto-adjust the light intensity, and simplify the process to change the light and font. This kills the experience a bit.I did give this a harsh rating. I am not saying this reader is bad. On the contrary I think it's the best reader if you have a Prime membership. Period. But it is super frustrating that a mega-company like Amazon would introduce features that many users will never use or do not care for, and neglect the many features that readers will appreciate (not to mention that most of its competitors have already integrated better light control and design!). It is for this that I will weigh the cons more critically.Thank you for taking the time to read this. This is my first review of this length, but I felt like I really had to inform the public and Amazon of how conflicted I am with this reader.

Tammy,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHQQNHUNNNCWN3YY7BB2GCNR2FUQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,On the fence 1/9/19 Update - Going Back - Making it a 1 star,1,Verified Purchase,Digital Storage Capacity: 8Offer Type: With Special OffersColor: BlackOption: Without Kindle Unlimited,"My husband bought me the 32 GB (Wi-Fi, without offers) for Christmas. I have until the end of the month to make a decision on whether or not I want to keep it. I have owned the keyboard, touch and the previous two Paperwhite's. I still have the previous Paperwhite and will keep it as a backup - or go back to it if I return this one. I had no issues with that one...I just wanted something with more storage for my Audible books and I really liked the idea of the screen being one continuous piece without the bezel.Like many have said before me, this thing is a fingerprint magnet and there is absolutely no way around it short of wearing gloves when you are handling it. I find I'm constantly wiping the front off off because it drives me nuts. Maybe if they come out with a white one it won't be as noticeable on the casing surround the reading screen, but it sure is on the black one. Just entering my pass code leaves little marks on the screen as does when you turn the page, hit the home button, etc. I'm not sure why they changed the texture of the screen when the previous one was phenomenal and didn't leave prints. I ordered a skin that will cover the black portion, which I've used on all my previous Kindles to make it look more original. With that taking care of the fingerprint issue on the case I will only have to worry about the actual reading screen. Hopefully that will be enough to curb my OCD.I also experienced battery issues. I fully charged it on the 30th, unplugged it and went back to it an hour later and it was at 94%. I did what others suggested and did a hard reset to see if that would help. I will keep an eye on it - I'm a heavy reader and charged my previous one every 2-3 weeks. I was busy the past few days and didn't use it as much as I normally would have. I also have this one set up with the same day and night settings as my last one to compare. As it is, it looks like it will have to be charged every weekly, if not sooner - it has already dropped to 56%. That's a considerable drop from my old one. Disappointing and no where near as long lasting.On the plus side, it is soooo light - easy to hold and balance and use the same hand to turn pages. Buttons for page turning would be awesome, but not a deal breaker for me. I also want to point out the on/off button placement. It does seem more sensitive - I never ""accidentally"" turned off my other one when handling/reading. I've done it several times with this one.So with that being said...I'm on the fence. It's a lot of money to spend if I'm not 100% happy with it...so I'm going to use it for the next couple of weeks and decide from there whether it's worth keeping or not.1/9/19 Update - Sending it BackStill having issues with the battery. Went ahead and ordered the expensive Amazon charger to give them the benefit of the doubt...It kept getting hung up anywhere between 95-98% even after the light showed fully charged when using the old one. I let it get down to about 15% before I tried the new one. It took forever to charge up and show the fully charged green light. Turned it on and it's stuck at 95%. Plugged it back in and gave it another 15-20 minutes. Still at 95%. Went to their help page and did a hard reset for the second time and tried another charger. 20 minutes later I can get it up to 99% after continuously inserting and removing the USB cable. Glad I didn't get rid of my previous version Paperwhite...would love this one if the battery/charging wasn't such a dud.",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/R2FBE8ZGPRRYPW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"January 2, 2019",One

In fact, I'm having a hard time writing this review without raving about the thing! The back light is even, the design is attractive, pages turn quickly and effortlessly, the battery is superb, and it's light weight. What's most impressive though is how extremely customizable it is. I love that I can have the time at the top of the page, that I can choose whether to view book location or page number. ""Collections"" take the place of the ""book shelves"" that Nook had in its first edition but inexplicably scrapped with the glow light; they allow the reader to organize large libraries. With the help of Calibre, I can convert and move over all of the older books that I used to keep on my Nook. It is going to take me some time to learn all of the ins and outs of this thing, but I am really loving it. I look forward to learning more about the lending library (wow!) and Whispersync.

However, once I started using this compact little reader, I found it to be excellent.  The lighting is good.  Using it outside was really good.  My older Kindle was not useable in the sun.  This one seems to work fine.  Also surprising is the battery storage.  Kindle's overall have very good battery life but this little one is better than the older models. I think the dictionary access is also better.I am not wild about the touch screen, yet.  Maybe it takes getting use to.  There is no home button on the bottom of page as on the older models.  I find this inconvenient.  While a small thing, I miss the blue book mark.  There is a bookmark but not as appealing, to me anyway. I do wish the chargers were interchangeable.  Amazon sends a cable but no converter (transformer).  Luckily the USB is standard and I could use my iPhone converter.  Not convenient though.

Wait for further production refinements.",3,,Digital Storage Capacity: 8Offer Type: With Special OffersColor: BlackOption: Without Kindle Unlimited,"I'm a long-time fan of the Kindle e-reader line, and eBooks in general, ever since I got my first Kindle Keyboard back in 2010 during college and became a voracious reader again. I don't write reviews often (if at all), but the Kindle is so close to my heart that I felt the need to put my thoughts on the 2018 Paperwhite model into words to help others make a decision.I had a Voyage (bought around launch in 2014) as my daily driver as well as a Paperwhite 3 (that I gifted to my girlfriend as her first Kindle) so I've had plenty of experience with different models leading up to this refresh. I traded in my Voyage as part of the Kindle trade in program as I always had minor complaints with that model and was incredibly excited about a new Paperwhite, the model that I felt had the best design philosophy, comfort and price to quality ratio. Unfortunately, after multiple trips to the Amazon Bookstore and 4 separate trade ins due to various hardware related issues, I simply can't recommend the new Paperwhite in its current form.The first one that I got had one LED that was much brighter than the others, casting a noticeable beam of light straight up the middle of the screen that outshone the others, as well as a very creaky construction to the plastic of the body when held on various parts of the bezel. The second that I got had great lighting, but had a bright ""stuck"" pixel near the center of the device. The third device had one LED that was noticeably dark and warm, and another LED that was incredibly bright and cool, making half the screen look as though it was in the shade and the other half look like a flashlight was shining on it. The fourth and final one that I tried had a good screen, but an insanely creaky and cheap feeling construction to the body-- just simply holding the device with little extra pressure applied made the Kindle squeak and crinkle as if something was loose or not properly glued inside of it. Eventually I returned this final device and simply purchased a Paperwhite 3 (the 2015 model), which after everything is said and done I couldn't be happier with.This brings me to my final point. I fully admit that I simply got unlucky with my purchases and that other people have gotten flawless Kindles from this first batch of production, but even without the issues I experienced the device as a whole feels ""cheaper"" than the Paperwhite 3. The construction feels hollower and less sturdy, the smooth screen lacks the texture of the previous model and feels like a fingerprint covered plastic phone screen, and the power button feels loose and all too sensitive to accidental presses. In almost every way it feels like a step down in build quality from the previous Paperwhite model, which is the gold standard for e-reader construction in my personal opinion. The previous model felt like a true electronic book, whereas this model feels more like a cheap tablet.I believe much of this comes from the fact that this 2018 model is in its first production run, and I have a great amount of faith in Amazon's tech and research teams to figure out all weak points and iron them out over the next few months and years. I plan on eventually purchasing another later down the line, and if the construction and quality has improved I will be more than happy to write another review with my updated feelings. As of right now, however? I'd advise sticking with the Kindle you already own and waiting a while for improvements or next year's luxury model, or purchasing a Paperwhite 3 instead.",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/RTPS27V3RDSVK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"November 20, 2018",23

When you wake up the device, it goes to full brightness before restoring to the user settings for lighting levels. This means that the device is blinding in a dark room. This has not been an issue with my previous Kindles.2. The battery life is hot garbage and I leave mine on airplane mode. I had one of the earliest Kindles on the market followed by a couple of later versions and have never had such a short lived Kindle battery. This has been the only Kindle that’s made me nostalgic for paper books whose batteries never threaten to die mid-sentence.3. Turning the pages of your library is an absolute nightmare with the touch screen. There’s an insufficient margin around the text such that if you’re trying to go to the next page of your library there’s a better than even chance that you’re going to unintentionally open a book instead.  Doing so renders the “recent” sorting option rather useless.4. I’m trusting that it’s waterproof. But I had a perfectly good waterproof case for my previous kindle and it had none of the issues of this version of the Paperwhite.So I’m going back to my old Kindle and when it well and truly croaks, I’ll likely switch brands.

I'm constantly deleting books on my 6th Gen because the low Memory popup is almost a constant.From first use, I noticed the screen had more of a soft, hazy Yellow Backlight than my bright White older version, and thought maybe it was me, that I would get used to it and there was a purpose behind it. It's been three weeks, I've read approximately six books, and find that I dread using the new Paperwhite. While I can't find fault with button placement or Interface setup, (it's not noticeably different from any other Kindle Paperwhite) the lack of a clear, bright Backlight defeats the purpose of purchasing a Kindle Paperwhite, (see my photo with 10th Gen on left, 6 Gen on right).The other issue is battery life. If I never read from the Paperwhite, I suppose the battery will last for weeks or months. However, while it's marginally better than the 6 Gen when it comes to holding a charge, I still have to plug the Kindles in twice a week when alternating between two, and four times a week when using one.

I decided to switch to a Kindle Paperwhite because the kindle fire was too heavy and the backlighting was straining my eyes.My first impression of this new device is that it is definitely slimmer and lighter which is good (it even feels like its lighter than my iPhone 7). It is also waterproof and has inversion of text so that it is easier to read at night (no comfort lighting though). I also liked that they included bluetooth for audio book listening. However, my Kindle Fire already had this function plus Immersion reading (which this doesn't have). This wasn't too much of a big deal, since I don't really use audio books and if I did I guess I could always use my kindle fire.One of my complaints is the power button position on the new 2018 paper white. The power button sticks out and is in a position where my hands accidentally press the power button. My kindle has the power button on the side and it doesn't stick out, so I never have the issue with accidentally pressing it.This new device has a flush screen which I am pretty use to since all of my devices seem to have one (cell phone and the kindle fire). It does attract more fingerprints but so does my other devices. Its easy to clean and doesn't really bother me. People have said that this device has more glare than the previous model, but I can't really compare because I've never owned the previous models. All I can say is that there is less of a glare compared to my iPhone and kindle fire which is a huge difference for me. I do wish they had the color white like they did for the previous model. Overall, it looks aesthetically beautiful because of the flushed screen and I have seen pictures of the previous model on the bottom where it was a bit thick, this one is flat and slim. I also like the fact that you can temporarily disable the touch screen (if the previous model didn't have it that would be kind of annoying for me because I accidently touch the screens pages and go to the next page). As for the battery life amazon says that if you read for 30 mins a day with the light setting at 10 it should last for weeks. I'm not sure how true this is I read for a couple of hours and the battery life went down by 10%. I don't think this will be an issue because it still lasts longer than my kindle fire would and I can always just plug it in to charge it. I would recommend this device if you need a waterproof and lightweight reading device.",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/R2C5K8ARN33BYS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"November 30, 2018",One

I am CONSTANTLY turning the thing off an on while I read. I bump it with my hand or it switches off as I turn the page off when kindle is propped up.  This is a MAJOR design flaw!!!Originally, I just wanted to compare it to the Voyage.... it is not as niceThis is bigger (lengthwise) than the Voyage although the screen is the same size. I believe it may be a bit thicker and perhaps a tiny bit heavier than the Voyage.  Unbelievably, the power button is at the bottom, not inconspicuously at the back and the new button actually sticks out a bit. Annoyingly, this means that the power is constantly bumped if it is  propped on a stand or bed pillows or if you like to hold it with one hand.It is not as ergonomically designed and is a bit more uncomfortable to hold.  However, the lack of a curve means there is room on the back to add a stand or a Bluetooth location/tracking device (a Tile or Nut, etc). Oddly, there is not a phone accessible “find my kindle” feature.Which brings me to the bluetooth compatibility, for my purposes this feature is completely worthless.  The Kindle will not pair with an iphone or with my car.Perhaps most painfully disturbing is the bright piercing white of the screen.  The screen is not the soft white of the Voyage or the slightly grayish color of earlier Paperwhites.  It is like reading from copy paper instead of a book.  To my eye, the Voyage has a slightly higher resolution.  Additionally, I suspect that the screen has a slightly slower flicker (maybe that helps with the extended battery life). It is not really visible like a computer screen.  I changed the settings for a black background and white type and that helped a bit.  There is also an small edge around the screenIt’s awesome that it is waterproof.I do not think this is an upgrade from the Voyage.",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/R2JRBSZZLZZBT4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"November 27, 2018",One

While I still prefer the feel of the older versions, I have come to appreciate the smoothness of the front screen. Yes, there are visible smudges on the edges, but with even the minimal backlight on, you can't see it, so it only bothers me when it's off. I had to wait a week or so before my favorite kind of cases became available for the new device, so it was frustrating waiting for the new cases, but now that I have the device in a nice case that I like, I'm happy. I haven't had a chance to test the waterproof part yet, but I'm very much looking forward to no-stress bathtub reading!! I never ran out of space on any of the old kindle versions, so extra storage now I suppose is for if you want to download a lot of audiobooks at once. I have maybe 30-50 ebooks on my kindle most of the time, with the rest in the cloud, so storage has never been an issue for me. As for the battery life, I have not experienced the issues other reviewers have. I typically keep my kindle on airplane to save battery, but with it being new and redownloading a lot of my books, I've left wifi on since I got it and haven't charged it since the day I received it, which was a week ago. My battery is still very high and I don't foresee any issues with battery charge in the future. Maybe I just got lucky or maybe the other reviewers got some lemons? Either way, I'm pretty happy with my device.",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/R1JQVJ302QIJKJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"November 14, 2018",One

When I put it on a stand to read, it shuts off. When I lean it on me to read, it shuts off. The only way to ""fix"" the problem is to read it in landscape mode...This is my first experience with a kindle. I had high expectations due to the price.Pros:1. Very customizable, can change language, font, font size, back light, ect.2. Pretty glare free, yet of course, screen is glass, so some glare was expected.3. Very compact and light.Cons:1. Screen smudges very easily. Which is bad as there are no page turning buttons, so you HAVE to touch the screen to turn page.2. Smudgy screen affects how clear the text is, which is very clear in areas not smudged.3. Slow to start after asleep, I'm not sure what other versions were like compared to this.4 & 5(I'll combine these as they are related)  I feel as it needs a case, and case selection is very limited. I wanted to test how it would be without a case, but as soon as I got it I had to get one. I didn't feel comfortable putting it in my purse since it smudges easily I figured it would scratch easy too.

My first was a 2009 Kindle (later known as Kindle Keyboard) and a 2012 Paperwhite.  I've loved each of those devices and felt no ""need"" to upgrade from my Paperwhite.  Then I was emailed an offer to get an instant $25 credit towards purchase of a new 10th generation Paperwhite, as well as an additional 25% off.  With the current special pricing for Valentine's Day, that meant I would only be spending about $50 for a new Paperwhite.  Very tempting.  But there were quite a number of reviews that weren't, pardon the pun, glowing.  Obviously I decided to take a chance, trade in my beloved 2012 Paperwhite, and purchase this 10th Generation one.  I am glad to say this was worth the risk!  White both models are by no means ""clunky"", this newest model is smaller and more compact.  I love that there is no bezel, the screen is flush with the entire device.  No more dust particles getting stuck in the corners.  The screen is also crisper, making the experience of reading even more immersive.  The lighting is pretty close, but definitely more of a ""white"" appearance than the 2012 which is more of a beige color.  I haven't used the Audible connectivity and that wasn't a feature that particularly interested me.  I also don't plan to use it in a water setting, but it's nice to know it should be resistant if it were accidentally get exposed.All this to say, if you're contemplating getting this device, or trading in a previous Paperwhite, I think you'll thoroughly enjoy this upgrade.",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/R3H0EQ4Q9PIKQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"February 12, 2019",One

We figured it would be easy for her to use. Despite the simplicity of the concept of the product, it is impossible to find support. We were excited she would be able to switch between reading the book and listening to it- no support online on how to use this feature. Upon set-up, we were forced into making her a GoodReads account- no way to bypass this. Once we set up her bluetooth headphones, we found that she needs to buy each of the audible books she wants to listen to, along with the kindle version so she can switch between the two. SUCH A WASTE. The more I try to set this device up for her, the more I realize we have to sign-up for more accounts to otherwise meaningless platforms. I've looked online for support. Amazon's recommended form of using the kindle is through the apps you can download on your phone. I found that I need to download some other application called WhisperSync to use the audio version of this device? Another platform that we need to integrate to this already infuriating device. My mom has a hard time with technology but has been trying to push herself to learn more. I am really upset that her first venture was this wasteful device.

The screen size small and not true 6 inches. It's 6 inches from left bottom corner to right up corner but what about length from top to bottom! it's same as mobile phone with size 5.5 inches (Samsung J7 2016). For small device it's a little bit heavy (170 g-6 once) when other manufactures like Huawei made mobile with 6.53 inches with massive 4000 mha battery size and weighted 188g only.(you got my point right).performance: It's slow and need to be upgraded with faster CPU because you need to wait a second to open some PDF file and or transfer between documents and when you connected to internet for synchronize it takes a time to complete.Screen refresh need to be enhance especially when you zoom in and out. View angle from 45 degree look like real printed document but when you look at it from 90 degree it will look weak and brighter like mobile.Accessories: The device priced 128$ and Amazon asked 60$ for leather case and 40$ for normal case are you kidding me that half price of kindle!.In my opinion this Kindle paperwhite 4 need to be developed from scratch from outside design and from inside I hope Amazon add some color with new kindle to provide real valuable device for us and if you have kindle paperwhite 3 there is no much improvement here except for water proof, Bluetooth and doubled internal storage and offer 8, 32 gb inside.Battery is good for daily usage and the consumption as follow:6 weeks usage 1/2 hour per day3weeks usage 1 hour per day1.5 week usage 2 hours per day.The latest update add battery percentage and ARABIC keyboard but it's need to improve the support for ARABIC language.If you suffering from sensitive eyes like me I advice you to buy it it's comfortable for daily reading and you can subscribe with Amazon to read millions of books.1 star removed for design.1 star removed for old techincal spec.Battery issue fast drain in 3 hours",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/R1SG4ALZ1FLBW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"November 29, 2018",One

I received it without defects with the Amazon Kindle trade-in program. I owned the previous generation of Kindle Paperwhite (which I loved) and to be fair there are many aspects about this new edition that just don't stack up to it.As for the screen, it can be quite bright (or conversely quite dark, if you enjoy using natural light) but , as others have noted, it is not the same glare free screen of the last edition. There is an unpleasant sheen when reading by a window, even with blinds drawn.  I like that the screen is flat to the body but it does not have the same rough, tactile feel of the last generation which allured me to it. It was a joy to feel a texture similar to that of a book page. This new one is pretty much smooth.The addition of Audible capability is pretty nice and navigation is smooth. It's still quite easy to navigate E-books, not many changes there. One thing I find quite unpleasant is the battery life. It's not spectacular, but not abismal either. I could leave my old Paperwhite in my car in winter and still have a charge days, if not weeks, later. This one seems to last about a week or so with heavy use, and maybe three weeks if left alone. Maybe I'm harsh because I compare it through the lens of the former model.In summary: If you are looking for a waterproof, durable, Audible enabled E-reader with a decent battery life and massive storage capacity, then  by all means this is a good choice. However, if you still have the previous edition, then I feel you are making a mistake and you may want to consider holding onto it.

It was 22% earlier this morning, and I didn't turn it off or use it.Update, 1/27: The instructions for use of this Kindle are non-existent. I d/l books, go to the library or ""list"" for what that's worth, and the only books that pop up are 4 books I d/l when I got the dern thing.  On my old Kindle, there was a list. This one shows the book cover of the book being read, nothing else. How the heck do I find other books I've downloaded. Very frustrating!!  I watched a couple of videos, which were worthless, too, as they simply showed what you can do with this Kindle, not how to do it.  Changing from 5 stars to 3 for difficulty navigating this kindle.

Amazon Customer,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGKSCULEYRFTTFWVKZXMUJUXDSWQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,Newer isn't always better. / UPDATED 3-25-19,4,Verified Purchase,Digital Storage Capacity: 32Offer Type: Without Special OffersColor: BlackOption: Without Kindle Unlimited,"I am an avid reader and long-time Kindle user. I still have my Kindle Keyboard and the 1st generation Kindle Paperwhite. Over the years, I've amassed a HUGE digital library (over 2900 ebooks), most of which I like to keep on my Kindle because I like to reread the ones that are really good. Unfortunately, my old paperwhite just couldn't hold many and would start to freeze up if I kept more than 800 books on it at any given time. I was extremely excited to hear that the new Paperwhite had up to 32gigs of storage and could hardly wait to get one. It arrived 5 days ago and I cannot say I'm impressed by any of it. From what I've found, there are 4 major issues:1.) I've been trying to download my books since Sunday and 5 days later it's STILL downloading. Because of the sheer number of ebooks in my library, I went to the Amazon website and under my Content and Devices and did a SELECT and DELIVER TO in order to download faster, but that didn't seem to speed up the process any. It only downloads about 8-10 books at a time, then sits for nearly an hour before it downloads any more. I've tried using the sync button to get it to download faster but it tells me there's nothing new even though I know it's not anywhere near finished.2.) Battery life on this is nowhere near as good as the original Paperwhite. I can put this one in sleep mode at night and it's dead by morning. My old one would last weeks in sleep mode. While reading, I've noticed the battery draining at about 10% every 45 minutes with the light at the halfway mark.3.) As if all that wasn't bad enough, my new Kindle keeps restarting at random times. I can be scrolling through the pages to see what new books have downloaded since the last time I looked and will get through about 25 pages and the Kindle suddenly turns off and restarts for no apparent reason. I've also had this happen when I was in the middle of reading a book. Once the Kindle has restarted it reverts back to the main screen instead of picking up where it left off. This is HIGHLY annoying.4.) I attempted to download one of my audible books (I have over 200) to listen to while my ebooks were downloading... I got as far as getting it put in the Download Queu, but it never did download. And when the Kindle restarted itself, the audible book had been removed from the Queu, so 5 days after receiving it I still don't know if the Audible works or not bc I haven't been able to get it to download.All that being said, I give this 2 stars because it arrived within 2 days of ordering and because it does have more storage space... but that's all it has going for it. I feel Amazon should have tested these better before releasing them to the public. I can tell by the other reviews that I'm not alone in my disappointment. If I hadn't already given my old Paperwhite away to someone who didn't have one, I'd be returning this one. As it is, I'm just going to deal with this one and hope that the issues are simply glitches that will eventually get resolved with an update later on.UPDATE: After my initial review, I spoke with Amazon Customer Service who advised me to press and hold the power button for exactly 40 seconds to do a hard reset of the device. This did help a little. The download speed picked up and the device only rebooted itself twice the first day. I did another hard reset after all my ebooks were downloaded, and that seems to have eliminated the reboot problem. The battery life seems to be much better if you keep the wifi, bluetooth, and backlight all turned off. However, if you have them all turned on, the battery will drain within a matter of hours. Oddly enough, the more I use the Kindle, the fewer issues I have with it. I was finally able to download some of my audible books. And I was able to sync up my wireless earbuds to it fairly easily. I've changed my rating from 2 stars to 4 stars because, despite the issues I had when I was setting it up and getting my books loaded, it seems to be working much better now and I am no longer having any problems other than the battery life. For now I just plug it up in the mornings and let it charge while I'm at work so I will have plenty of battery for my nighttime reading and/or audible.",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/R1GR3K32LG2ADB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"March 15, 2019",One

R. Aufmuth,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AE5HK7OUBWLN6N6BGD2W6HIDOBNQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,Not bad,4,Verified Purchase,Digital Storage Capacity: 8Offer Type: With Special OffersColor: BlackOption: Without Kindle Unlimited,"Update:Amazon contacted me and spoke with me about the issues. I was sent a new Paperwhite and it is brighter. So I give Amazon 5 stars on customer service!!  Still kind of gray and not as white as the prior version of Paperwhite but brighter than the one I received first. Because the screen is grayer can't say it is brighter than the prior version of Paperwhite. It seems to not be so sluggish either, but is not as responsive as my older Paperwhite and definitely not as responsive as my Voyage (the best Kindle ever I feel). So i gave this a higher rating and changed the headline. I wish I could give the All New Paperwhite 5 stars but I can't because the screen seems gray, not as vibrant as the prior version.This is my fourth Kindle and I bought this one to upgrade the Paperwhite i bought less than a year ago (one I had bought to carry in backpack for reading on lunch at work and commuting on Light Rail) because I like the no bezel feature of the new Paperwhite. Also the, fact that there is one more LED and the water resistance enticed me also.The Paperwhite has never held a candle to the Voyage (I have a Voyage that I absolutely LOVE as it is so clear and sharp. Sucks they quit making that model and now make the odd shaped Oasis) when it comes tho brightness and sharpness. But to my chagrin, even though there is one more LED's in the All New Paperwhite, it is actually much dimmer along with the screen being grayer, not white. Maybe Amazon should change the name to Papergray?  The gray reminds me of my first Kindle, the Kindle Keyboard. See my picture comparing the new to prior version. The prior generation Paperwhite is on left with the All New Paperwhite on right. Very noticeable difference when both are set to 18 (what I set my Voyage to) on brightness. I am very disappointed in the fact that the All New Paperwhite while it actually costs more is not as bright and is much duller (grayer) than the prior version. Let alone not as sharp. The other issue I have is how slow and sluggish it is. From the very moment I opened it it was slow and sluggish. With no books on it going through the setup steps it was slow and sluggish. It even froze in middle of setup and I ended up having to power down and restart. After restarting I did a reset and an update. Not a good sign. The next day I opened the lid and screen was blank. I had to Google what to do as Amazon makes support on their website extremely hard to find, let alone any way to contact Amazon. I found out I had to hold power button for about 30 seconds or so. Even after doing the reset, it is still slow and sluggish.Another thing I noticed is how fast the battery drains. I keep wireless off and keep Bluetooth off. I charged it completely full and held power button to select turn screen off. It sat for close to 24 hours and when I opened cover and screen came up, i noticed it was at 90% charge without any use. Far worse than the prior version of Paperwhite or my Voyage.Don't get me started about the case for it either. The Amazon case for the All New Paperwhite is not as nice  and actually feels cheaper than the one for the prior version. The lid is thin (even though stiffer) and the edge is actually sharp so you cant really hold it like a book (sometimes I like to do that since flipping lid all the way around to the back makes the Kindle real thick and that gets uncomfortable after a bit) as the edge digs into your hand and starts to hurt after a short time.Another thing I noticed is when I flip the lid around the back Good Reads or the Store will open, At first when I would put cover to back the special offer would open. I was also having issues that whenever any of my fingers are near bottom of screen but not touching it or when trying to scroll through home screen pages to look for a book the special offer would open so it forced me to have to pay to ""unsubscribe"" from it. Did not have any issues with the special offers opening that easily on the prior version of Paperwhite. And that cover costs more too.  I am really disappointed in Amazon for making some improvements like no bezel (Voyage had that and I like it) and supposedly adding an LED but the quality has gone down.I definitely will not recommend the All New Paperwhite to anyone who is considering upgrading a prior version and will show anyone who is considering buying one what I have found. If I could return this and get my money back (including what I had to pay to unsubscribe from special offers) I would.

The light is adjustable, but will not acclimatize to room lighting, which is okay, because I always keep it at level 12 anyway. The print is fine and detailed. The reading experience is great as well, but I did notice that there is some glare on screen, which is the reason you would want a Kindle in the first place, the paper experience digitally. The glare kind of takes that away.

Despite technology advancements in smartphones that have made them more fluid and user friendly, ALL of the interface looks and feels EXACTLY like first a gen kindle.  The scrolling (of which there is thankfully little) and menu pull downs are finicky and stilted.  I can never get the main menu to drop down.  I accidentally flip pages all the time by touching the screen.  The screens change with a stiff, noticeable lag.  All the screens are monochrome.  It feels exceptionally dated.  Which is fine if I'm using a first gen Kindle.  But this thing is just a waste of money, same exact device with gimmicky touch features.Oh another gripe: the Wake Button at the bottom is easily bumped on and off ALL THE TIME.  And you now have to swipe the screen after you hit the button to unlock the device.  Which reminds me - there's often a boot lag when you unlock it, never had that before with 1st gen Kindle (it will say ""wait booting up"").  Anyhow, the wake button / swipe combo proves only a hassle to the Kindle owner as the device will still miraculously turn itself on in my gym bag and use up all its battery.  Meanwhile the wake button, if even touched slightly will put the device back to sleep.  I like to read on the elliptical or treadmill and this will happen very often - I will pick it up hit the wake button, swipe to unlock, then wait for to boot, put it down on the treadmill only to have it hit the button and put itself back to sleep.  Repeat.  So frustrating.  My friend has all the same problems.Back light is nice and waterproofness is a thoughtful feature.  However, not worth the pains aforementioned.  Maybe its just me but I find 98% of the time I am in a well lit area that is dry...Recently I had my car broken into.  The only thing they took was the Kindle Paperwhite which I had absent-mindedly left on my passenger seat (I'm usually good about bringing everything in Doh!).  I've never been robbed of something and felt so relieved.  I'm going back to my first gen Kindle.  I hope the thief is able to read something good on there, gain some insight about the world, and become a better person - but I really doubt they will get past the awful finicky cumbersome design.

That lighting inconsistency was the only thing stopping me from loving the PW4 100%.I finally reached out to other owners after about 2 weeks & found out the lighting was just my unit.

I don’t feel like dealing with the exchange process again & am afraid of the issues the next PW4 might have. With the lighting issues of the first & the dead pixels of the second, I am rating this 4 stars rather than 5. I do wonder if Amazon may have rushed these out a bit too quick or maybe I am just unlucky.Either way, everything else about the PW4 is spot on. I love the flushed screen.

In all cases, each newer generation has definitely improved on those before. For me, the best kindle is the Voyage and this new Paperwhite takes a lot of what made that great and incorporated it into the 'value for money' design of the Paperwhite.I like that the screen is flush with the bezel. The whole device is light and well sized. The lighting works fine; it's perhaps a bit more yellow than either Voyage I own but you really only notice that when you put the devices in direct proximity to each other. The lighting is very even and screen clarity is great,. Won't say its BETTER than the Voyage, which remains my favorite kindle ever, but for the price, it's absolutely a great choice.Purchase of the device includes 6 months of Kindle Unlimited (KU). Haven't decided yet whether to turn that on (I'd had a subscription once before) as I most of my reading lately is library book borrows, which works great once you get your local library card and eBook account. You can't really borrow from the library via the Kindle, but it's easy to return the books you've finished. KU is definitely worth trying if you haven't before. Most titles in the program are independently published titles and there are definitely some gems. For me, I felt like there was a lot of mediocrity as well, but the good thing is, if a book doesn't appeal, you can just send it back and pick something else.",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/R25C0Z8GRFIXN6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"November 13, 2018",One

I have a reading disability and having the audio as I read helps the words stay in the right order. I was happy to see that the new Paperwhite had VoiceView so I decided to upgrade. The reading part of VoiceView works fine, but the functionality of the system, while it's in Voice View, is abysmal. In order to turn on the feature, I have to go through three menus, which is required to turn on the feature, off the feature, or just adjust either the volume/ speed of the feature.  On top of that in order to navigate while the feature is on, I have to double tap every button to get into the menus. The first tap is to get it to read the menu item to me which is fine but it normally reads the item to me then returns the selection to the home icon before I can make the selection.  So when I tap the second time to go into settings instead I am returned to the home page and have to start the process again.  In the old version of the Kindle, I could turn the feature on and off in the quick menu and adjust volume in that same quick menu as it was running. Please put that quick access back into the system. Last but not least when you put the system in sleep mode while you are in Voiceview mode it prevents you from unlocking the screen. Instead of being able to ""slide up to unlock"" the system forces me to double tap the add and then go through the process of selecting through a bunch of menus again to get back to what I was reading. Please put that quick access to VoiceView into the system make it disabled on the lock screen.I will say I love being able to read in the Opendyslexic font. This font is very helpful and allows me to read long before my reading disability starts to cause me problems. pair this with the reading feature this Kindle is amazing. the only reason, I am giving the two stars is because of the Voiceview navigation, fix that and this would be a five-star Item for me.

I know it isn’t quite what I received.First the cons:Sluggish displayKlunky operating system compounded by sluggish displayNo power supply - it is an additional cost if you do not already have a usb type B charger!The pros:Excellent reading library availableGood reading surfaceComplaints: One of the things that is maddening to me is that the Kindle is seemingly less flexible than the application on, say, an iPad or Android device. One of the reasons this is upsetting is that there should be no question as to which device has a superior interface. Another issue, and I blame myself as much as I do anything else, is the small surface area on which there is taxed. For those unfamiliar with Kindle devices it is not much bigger than a smart phone as far as height goes. It is slightly wider with an agreeable enough dpi to make it high enough contrast and easy enough to read off of. My previous Kindle was a 2nd generation and for some reason I thought there would be more available screen size on the newer model. I should have paid a little more attention and I should have looked at the dimensions of the device. For those using an older devices like mine understand that it has become smaller while the is screen size has remained the same.  The older unit had a larger size body as they had physical buttons for navigating pages as well as for typing. They also had less dpi and there is definitely an improvement in the quality of the screen. To give the uninitiated some kind of concept by which to judge the size of this device consider a pocket sized paperback book.  The overall dimensions of the Kindle are smaller than a paperback while the overall reading section is even smaller.  To be fair the device does work quite well but comparing it to tablets in general the effective reading space it is, to me, fairly small.Positives: While I have quibbles about the overall size of the reading space it is very convenient and portable while being fairly light and easy to tote around. I love reading but it becomes a burden to continually find spaces for physical books even though my preferences run towards them. This is where the Kindle concept makes absolute sense. I do think it does a good job of putting the media in a good environment. While the apps may feature better interfaces and  offer more screen real estate it’s a pain in the neck to get new Kindle books unless you’re using an Amazon-based tablet as the store isn’t available. I say this only having experience with Fire and iPad tablets and can’t speak on Android devices.  You can use your tablet or computer to order Kindle books on the Amazon site but it’s a klunky experience. Admittedly the Fire tablet handles this the best as it has access to the store but after reading on it it’s just not an enjoyable experience.... for me.Overall you have to take into account what your preferences are and whether you will get a good amount of use out of the device. Some may see having an additional reader as unnecessary although I would definitely argue against that and would say that the paperwhite concept is a nice change from traditional tablet or phone screens.But that’s something you need to consider as no one else can truly give you a good opinion as to whether you would benefit from having an additional dedicated reading device.It’s good, it’s not quite great, and I suspect in another upgrade or two we will see a fully usable screen like the iPhone X or Galaxy 9 series.For now we have this latest iteration. It is hardly a massive upgrade from fairly recent models but compared to my antique 2nd gen Kindle it’s a substantial upgrade.For new users it should be agreeable. The GUI needs addressing as does the laggy interface. But I realize I’m partial to these types of issues whereas most users won’t find issue at all.I won’t be using it outdoors much as I purchased the Kindle in Feb. and have no great desire to read in the cold weather so I have no comment on how it performs in bright light situations.",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/R2HZADO6I897GK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"February 13, 2019",
WhiteDog,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHJPOHBCEJAW6RFIMFCY4IO5EAOQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,Good replacement policy,5,Verified Purchase,Digital Storage Capacity: 8Offer Type: Without Special OffersColor: BlackOption: Without Kindle Unlimited,"I ordered this new model, 10th generation, Kindle Paperwhite to replace an old one that was beginning to show signs of failing health. The first one I received, however, had a flaw. When used with a case, either the metal one that is custom made for this model, that turns it on and off when opening or closing, or the old cardboard and cloth one from my previous Kindle, this model would freeze with some regularity. Without a case it worked just fine. When I called Amazon technical support, no one else seems to have experienced this problem, but Amazon made replacing it fairly easy just the same. I doubt they actually took the time to test it; they probably just tossed it in the recycle bin and sent me a new one immediately. The replacement model seems to be working fine. What was particularly nice is that I could set up a tech support phone call directly on the Kindle, and they called me back right away. I give Amazon high marks for their customer support.The higher screen resolution means type is no longer fuzzy. There are more fonts to choose from. Battery life is better and the WiFi is stronger. Which means that I can order additional books directly on the Kindle, whereas I previously had to use my computer. Downloading with the old Kindle was problematic. This new one downloads a book as soon as I purchase it. Most important, for me, is that I can adjust the type size, screen brightness and layout for easy reading. My eyes are photo-sensitive so the ability to dim the screen to reduce glare is important to me. And the screen is evenly illuminated, unlike the screen in my old Kindle. Indeed, Amazon offers three kinds of Kindle; I think the old e-ink versions are still available. Then there is the ever improving Paperwhite, which works well for me, where the other models would not. And, of course, the full color Kindle Fire, which is a full featured color tablet.I haven't tested it's water resistance yet, but being water proof means that I can read it in the bath with less concern about getting it wet. Even the cloth covered metal case is water-resistant. So, all in all, this is a much improved version of the Kindle Paperwhite. Although I'm glad I waited to upgrade. The new feature set is impressive. Also, it is much lighter than my previous Kindle, which was by no means heavy. So the added weight of the case is welcome.Further, Amazon makes it easy to set up the new Kindle, linking it to my account. One drawback, however, it that, while it lists all my previous purchases, which are in the Amazon cloud, I have to download them one at a time, which is tedious to say the least. A ""download all"" option would be nice. The new Kindle has much more storage so all my books would hardly make a dent in what it can hold. My old Kindle was not nearly full, with more than 150 books.While I still like old fashioned paper books, I don't have room for many more in my apartment. Of course I could toss many of my existing volumes, which I will probably never read again. But that would involve making difficult choices. And Kindle books are usually much less expensive. So I'm reading more as a result. Though the cost still add up.Even though the first one was flawed, Amazon made it easy to get a replacement, so I'm still giving this new Paperwhite high marks. As the saying goes, all's well that ends well.",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/R19Y3LPN2H9RNM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"January 15, 2019",

The lost Kindle, now found, was in perfect working shape and undamaged. It sits in my library now  waiting for my next mistake! )Four points. First, it is all too easy on this version to hit the ""off"" button at the bottom accidentally. I don't know how to redesign it to prevent this, but it would be a good idea if doable.  Second, the ""flush-front"" design seems slicker, but so what? It's actually a bit harder to hold than the older version. Third, the surrounding black border is quite wide at top and bottom, presumably to permit the user to get a better grip on it under all circumstances. But a slightly bigger reading page ought also to be possible with these rim widths. Last, a longer lasting battery, desired by the entire world, would be great, but not if one has to give up the flatness and light weight of this version.I see your newer version promises this, but not in specific, measurable terms. C'mon, Amazon. Give it to us straight! It gets a five from me in spite of all of this. If possible I'd give it a six.I see there's a new other Kindle version now (Oasis) that gives  larger reading page without losing the essential smallness of the device. Good!  But the Oasists rim looks too narrow except on the right-hand side  to hold comfortably with the left hand or at the top or bottom. For that reason, I am unlikely to get one, but I'll check the reviews on this issue.  Bigger screen by an inch is not worth  loss of ease of use and easy finger/hand placement in all positions, all places, and all circumstances.Note to Amazon: Your technology is a wonder, but are you really doing your very  best with ergonomics experts in your design department? You do have them I hope. Do you?",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/R2762XT7ERBL0R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"March 21, 2019",

Material not too sturdy,3,Verified Purchase,Digital Storage Capacity: 8Offer Type: With Special OffersColor: BlackOption: Without Kindle Unlimited,"It’s a nice upgrade from the Kindle 8th gen. I like the light and how you can adjust it but as usual the battery is disappointing and does NOT last for weeks as advertised even with minimal use and dim lighting.Few more things:1. I hate that Amazon removed the option to link to your Facebook account and be able to share quotes from the book to Facebook. I don’t know what that’s about but it sucks.2. When you upload your documents via USB, the people/family who are supposed to have access to your content won’t get them on their kindle device. So, you would have to email them to the kindle email in order for them to view them. That’s pretty inconvenient and could’ve been made better but I don’t know why they didn’t make the effort to simplify things for the users.3. The back gets easily scratched. I had mine for a few days and I’m very careful with my things but it already has a lot of scratches. So I was forced to buy a kindle cover to protect the back. The material of the back also attracts a lot of dirt and it’s hard to remove.4. It is slightly bigger, not by much, from the previous kindle (8th gen). That’s a good thing. It’s also thinner. Not much difference in weight.5. I find the material of the device generally poor quality. Like I said, I’m very careful in handling my electronic devices and it already has a small chip at the base even though I never dropped or bumped it plus it already has a case.Overall, I expected this product to be a lot sturdier than what it is for $100+ item.

So, reading hands free at a table is inconvenient. My primary reason for purchase is also. I have a stand in my bath tub for reading, and the Paperwhite reboots constantly. I have had to fashion a cushion so that it is elevated on the button side, and sits at a slight tilt. WHY wasn't the switch placed on the top????

Of course, I can use my phone for listening to Audible, but why run down its battery?  Plus, by listening on this new Paperwhite you don't have other apps, calls, or notifications interfering or slowing down your listening pleasure.So far, I'm really enjoying it, however, navigating the VoiceView screen reader accessibility has a bit of learning curve (Kindle does have an onboard tutorial to follow) and I suppose this would seem more difficult for anyone who is legally blind, at least until they get the knack of it (that’s just my guess anyway).

I say this as someone who was skeptical.,4,Verified Purchase,Digital Storage Capacity: 8Offer Type: Without Special OffersColor: BlackOption: Without Kindle Unlimited,"I am a former Kindle 3 owner, and for a long time I saw no reason to upgrade. But eventually the Kindle Keyboard stopped holding a charge and got really sluggish. Still, hard to complain, it lasted me seven years. After the Kindle died, I converted all my books to new formats or read on the Kindle app via an Asus Zenpad S 8.0 and it was a rather pleasant experience. I really liked it with its 2k resolution screen, and Moon Reader+ is a wonderful app for reading, so I was reluctant to update to a new Kindle. Just wanted to provide some background for my perspective.The new 2018 Kindle has blown away my expectations. Initially I didn't like it. ""It's too small"" I said, after reading on an 8"" tablet, but I adjusted quickly enough and am finding reading to be an enjoyable experience again. It's simple, the UI is much faster than my old Keyboard model, and getting more books is always a simple affair with Amazon. The Goodreads integration is nice as well.Initially I felt the backlight was too bluish but I got used to it. I still feel the device would benefit from some yellow or reddish LEDs for night reading, but just dimming it down is fine. The reading experience is great in any lighting, from bright sun to a pitch black room, and the lighting control is great.I've read of battery life issues and light pinholes on the screen but I've experienced neither issue. The screen on mine came flawless, and the battery life has been what I expect. I've finished six books since purchasing it and am reading the seventh now. I've charged it twice now, but the first time the battery was still around 50%, and the second time it was only down to 79%, so really I've yet to do a full 100% charge after 6+ books and over 3 weeks of use. I will say I usually have the light somewhere between 6 and 11, so maybe those with battery issues are keeping a brighter screen. At high brightness it looks too much like a tablet display to me, and I prefer only enough light for comfortable reading.Lastly, I'm not sure when Amazon added it, but the ability to use custom fonts is a godsend. I love Google's Literata font, and it looks great on the Kindle and is very easy on the eyes. I'm not sure if this is common, but I read with small line breaks and the second smallest font option, and it's all great. I love this as a feature, and it should have been a thing years ago.The 2018 Paperwhite is absolutely worth the purchase, especially if you don't have a Kindle or are upgrading from an older model.======================================Update - 3/15/2019 - this morning I opened my Kindle to a completely garbled screen. Unreadable from books to interface, and I was briefly concerned the screen had been damaged. Held the power button down, fumbled for the restart option, and managed to get it to reboot... and then it was working normally again.This is the second time my screen got weird. The first time the entire bottom row of pixels in the book I was reading was showing at the top of the screen. This time, all the lines were cut in half and split all over the page. I'm docking a star, as this thing has some serious software bugs if the screen can wig out that way twice in the six weeks I've had it. Frankly, I'm tempted to dock two stars on the review simply for it making me think my screen was broken just outside the return period...",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/R1ABFRI4G6EQ45/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"March 1, 2019",

I was told when I bought it I could not get the version without the Adverts and it wasn't available to order on amazon.com, but Customer Service CAN and WILL give you the upgrade to removed the Adverts if you ask, and that is a huge improvement in using the device.  Now when I either open my magnetic case or tap the button on the bottom, it comes on immediately right where I left off.  This also removed the adverts on the home screen and replaced them with the pen & ink drawings of book-related pictures.My Customer Service Rep also walked me through placing my device in ""airplane"" mode to save the battery, which is a different process from my old Kindles.  This has given me a very big improvement in performance, as it been more than a week and I am at more than 50% power left.  So about 2-3 weeks on a charge when I am reading for 3-4 hours per day.As far as accidentally hitting the button on the bottom, I am getting better at knowing where it is and not hitting it at much in the magnetic case (problem completely eliminated with the padded aftermarket case) and even when I do hit it, tapping the button makes it come back immediately without even waiting a second.So, I am willing to admit most of my issues were USER ERROR and I love my new Kindle now.EARLY REVIEW:I love Amazon and I absolutely love my old Kindles (plural).  I bought the first generation with the slide switch and a case that held my IttyBitty Book Light.  It was great.  After several years of reading, it was starting to reboot itself every few weeks and I thought perhaps the end was getting near.  So I bought the PaperWhite and was in love all over again.  I took it everywhere; hotels, doctor appointments, camping, any vacation, etc.  After a few years, it starting rebooting itself and I thought this would be a good opportunity to get the waterproof PaperWhite since we camp quite a bit now.KEEP YOUR OLD KINDLE!!My old PaperWhite turned on by tapping the button at the bottom and within one to two seconds, it opened to wherever I left off. The new one requires me to tap the button, wait several seconds to be sure I have more than enough time to view the ads a few times, and then I have to swipe to open.  I can’t look away or I might miss the swipe and have to start over.The option to buy one without the adverts was NOT AVAILBLE, and paying to upgrade will not improve the experience, per the sales people at the Kiosks in my area.The old PaperWhite had pen and ink line drawings of various book related vignettes, giving it an old, book like comfort.  The new one has advertising - not really a big deal, but I am bombarded with ads to the point I find them aggravating.The old PaperWhite My Library showed my books - the new one show ads and a couple of my books.  Searching the Kindle Store is equally obnoxious on the new PaperWhite.The new recommended case for the new PaperWhite is very thin and hard.  It does not take up a lot of space, is light weight, has a magnetic on when opened (to the adverts) but I still have to swipe to see my book.  It is also so small that if I rest the Kindle on my lap or anywhere, it pushes the button on the bottom to turn it off - and I don’t have an opportunity to cancel the action, such as needing to swipe it off, it just goes off.  And then I have to go through the 2 step and several second process of turning it back on.  This new case is also fairly uncomfortable to hold so after several times of accidentally turning the Kindle off when I wanted to just turn the page, I replaced it with an aftermarket case that is softer and more comfortable to handle and protects the bottom button from accidental activation.The old PaperWhite came with a charging cord that I could plug into any outlet, or remove the plug and use the USB to charge from my computer.  The new one came with the cord and USB but I had to pay extra for the plug.  I was told it was because Amazon does not know for sure what type of plug I would want, so it is now separate.  I am using Amazon in the US, I live in the US and I pay in US dollars.  What plug to you think I might want?Both of my older Kindles needed to be recharged every 2-3 weeks.  The new PaperWhite is every 3 days.  I cannot take this camping as there is frequently no electricity available.Seriously, go with the older PaperWhite WITHOUT adverts.  I am considering returning this one and getting another older one.  I still love the Kindle reading experience, but I am very unhappy with the new one.",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/R1JVHA6XOGO81X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"February 22, 2019",

And slower?,2,Verified Purchase,Digital Storage Capacity: 8Offer Type: Without Special OffersColor: BlackOption: Without Kindle Unlimited,"So I think the fact that it is a touchscreen is pretty important to mention in the product highlights. It totally changes the way I can use it and that is not what I was looking for. First of all, I wanted a waterproof kindle so that I can read in the spa, but since it is touchscreen, I can't wipe off the water without changing the font size. Unlike my old Kindle I can't just put it into a seat pocket or throw it in my backpack without locking it, so I will have to develop new habits and break old ones. Since the margins are fairly small and I have average size man hands, it can be hard to handle and pick up without accidentally turning a page. Another thing I don't like is that the actual reading surface is recessed well below the glass so it creates a lot of refraction when water droplets get on the screen and makes it harder to read. They say it is the lightest yet, but it is noticeably heavier than my old kindle, so I guess they are just straight up lying on that claim and hoping no one notices? it is also much slower than my old Kindle. it takes longer to turn pages, and browsing my library and returning to the home screen have noticeable delays, which my old kindle does not. Not sure how they are moving backward after 5 years. Some of the changes that the touchscreen brings are easy to appreciate, like having a full keyboard for logging into wifi, but again it is not what I was looking for and I can't believe they would fail to mention something that important so I will be returning it and sticking with my beat up 5-year old Kindle which is superior in nearly every way.",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/R3E298TNULMHRL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"April 12, 2019",

This was near perfect in every way for me as a student. This new Kindle is ok, many good and a few bad things. I will list them all here.Good - The screen is clear, and smooth. The missing boarder and lack of bezel is a very welcome enhancement that improves the reading experience.

By Monday, I took it out of my bag and saw that the top of the device was peeling and there were deep lines across the screen. About twenty minutes after trying to read with it the screen darkened and the lines made the entire page unreadable. I couldn't navigate back home or into the settings because the texts on the screen we're overlapped, dark, and marked with streaks across it.I am not sure if the ultra thinness of the product made it more susceptible to damages, but my older and more rugged Kindles never had this issue. This one is surely defective.Update: So, immediately after posting this I was sent an email from Amazon's customer service. I gave them a call during my lunch break and they offered to ship me a new one and have me return the defective device. The device was shipped to me after two days and I am trying it out. I appreciate the customer service and rapid response, however this new one seems to be a little lighter (text and resolution is kind of faint and I'm guessing it was possibly refurbished) than the previous one.Perhaps I am comparing it to my older Kindles subconsciously, but I am actually preferring the plain previous generation Kindle with Bo backlight over this one.",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/R11N2KLBY7G9FN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"March 18, 2019",One

Unfortunately, even though it was barely even visible it rendered the touchscreen inoperable so I replaced it with the latest Paperwhite and have been sorely disappointed.First, the power button on the bottom is a TERRIBLE design.  It's somehow always in the way and gets triggered accidentally far too frequently.  It wouldn't be as bad if I could change the orientation so I could use the device upside down but that's not an option.The time to turn pages seems much longer than on the Voyage, enough that I notice it each time.The touchscreen responsiveness is terrible.  There's significant touch latency.I miss the adaptive brightness (that automatically adjusts based on light levels) from the Voyage.  It wasn't perfect on that device but now it's missing entirely.I also wish it used USB-C since that's the direction most phones are going in and I'd rather not bring multiple charging cables.As for the features they added, they're nice, but I don't really use any of them.  Waterproofness is definitely nice to have though I've never had a device get wet so it's not a huge deal for me.  The Bluetooth isn't really necessary since I just use my phone for Audible.  In fact I almost always have Airplane mode turned on on the Kindle to save battery and as a result my books aren't synced.This is a regression in almost every regard from previous generations.",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/R2AVGM35UH5G71/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"January 21, 2019",One

It is OK. The charge issue that I complained about is actually satisfactory and plugging in/out to charge the device is not as difficult. But, I do want to comment that this device's bottom section should be broader (see photos of my new and old devices) as my old Kindle was. More depth would hinder fingers slipping onto the screen--which then changes the location indicator/time remaining notification. (I love that feature, especially to determine ""can I finish this book before bedtime, or???) Finally, a suggestion: put the charging plug and on/off switch at the top of the device. Why, you ask? Because, if you are like me and read with the Kindle resting on a pillow, you can accidentally turn the device on or off if you move wrong. (Plus, and this is just me, my cats like to cuddle beside me and I have pulled many a long kitty hair out of the socket!) ORIGINAL REVIEW: This is so much less satisfactory to my prior Kindle Paperwhite, which, after 4 years of steady use, gave up the ghost. As so many have noted, this model's charger cable is difficult to plus in and out (note to y'all: I had another Kindle that was difficult to plug in/out which died after less than a year of life. I'm not sure if the two issues are connected [see what I did there? LOL] but it's worth noting). The contrast is also less satisfying (to me, at least) and more difficult to get where I want it. What can I say? It does the job, but, not to the standard I was hoping for. UPDATE on 3/9/19: I have had this for less than a month and, already, it is losing it's charge very quickly. After 2 hours of reading, my device was down to 80% charge--from 100%. That is excessive. When I first used the device, a chunk of reading time such as this would not take even 10% of a charge.

I loved my paperwhite I had since 2014 with zero problem but ordered the new one released 11/18 due to it being smaller and waterproof. What a complete disappointment it has been!!1. 11/19 I received the new one, it lasted 2 weeks before it completely froze and tech support couldn't fix it. I ordered a replacement.2. I got my 2nd Kindle 12/19 (it may have been a refurbished one since it was a replacement, not sure) and have been using it for almost 3 months until it began not working, shutting down for no reason, the light wasn't dimming properly, sluggish and I only have 160 book downloaded on it. NOT HAPPY!! Returned it and ordered an new one.3. Now I'm on my 3rd 10th generation Kindle in less than 4 months (I've had it for a couple of days now) and extremely disappointed to say the least. The light dimmer on it's lowest setting still is bright, nothing they can do. If you press too quickly, the screen will go completely black which is stupid. Why would they do that? I've downloaded my 160 books and it seems to be quicker which is a positive.I have loved my old Kindle paperwhite and gifted it to a friend or else I would be back to using it and a happy customer. It's no longer available to buy as new. If anything goes wrong with this 3rd once, I will be sure to update this.Bottomline, if you have an older paperwhite that is fully functioning, do not get rid of it, it's gold! The new features on the 10th generation kindle aren't as important as the problems I'm now experiencing. If you've never owned a paperwhite and want to get one...good luck!!P.S. If you need to return, I HIGHLY SUGGEST that you take pics of the list of your downloaded books (alphabetical by title is best) so when you get your replacement, you know exactly which books to download.

Not much, just a noticeable amount.Speed: The new waterproof Paperwhite takes a few seconds more to wake up than my older Paperwhite did. That throws off my start-up rhythm, but it is really not too objectionable.All in all, the main reason I upgraded is that my old Paperwhite was not behaving correctly and a hard reset did not restore it.

Light weight and  Portable. 4 1/2 Stars on this one!,4,Verified Purchase,Digital Storage Capacity: 8Offer Type: With Special OffersColor: BlackOption: Without Kindle Unlimited,"I got this during the 1 day MLK sale at $40 off the regular price. In the past, I have only had Kindle Fires: 7"" HDX and the 6"". I wanted a super light weight Ereader that I could read in bright sunlight. The PaperWhite is a mear 6 oz. Add in a Fintie Cool Jade cover and it is only 10 oz total. It is much slower than the HDX. It takes a few seconds to ""wake up"" after opening the cover. The entire interface is different than on the HDX or the Kindle ap on my IPad Pro. It will just take some getting used to. I really wanted the Kindle Oasis but couldn't bring myself to spend 2x the amount for buttons to flip the pages and an extra inch of screen space (7"" as opposed to 6"")It is good for what it does: Lets you read your books in just about any lighting situation. No email, texting, FB, phone calls or Candy Crush. Just clear crisp text on your Ebooks. At 300ppi you can't go wrong. The adds? Personally, I like them. Good book suggestions. No game suggestions since it doesn't support games. I only keep two books loaded on PaperWhite:  My current book and my ""on deck"" book. This  is my secondary device that only goes to work with me or when I'm traveling. Four solid stars on the Kindle PaperWhite. 🌟🌟🌟🌟Update: 2-26-19. I've had this for several weeks now. I'm really enjoying it. I love the fact that it is so light and adds very little extra weight to my purse. The cover keeps the screen protected and works to wake/sleep the device. I get many compliments on the Cool Jade cover. I've gotten used to the fact it is NOT a tablet but an E-Reader.  I still would have liked the Kindle Oasis but I love the $170 savings. $249.99 vs $89.99 on the MLK day sale. More money to buy books. I'm upping my rating to 4 1/2 stars.Update: 4-9-19. Two minor annoyances: The PaperWhite doesn't really sync with my other devices. If I read on my Kindle ap for IPhone or on my HDX the PaperWhite doesn't seem to know I've read on another device. (My Kindle ap and HDX always sync). Also the ads are non specific. I open my PaperWhite and the screen has a picture telling me the Kindle library has over 80,000 books. This happens about 80% of the time. My HDX always has relevant suggestions based on my reading habits. If you have ads, make them worth my time to look at.

And, up front I want to say that I LOVED my old one.  It was great until it started acting up after 4 years.  It's the reason I had to buy a new one much to my disappointment.  I felt it should have lasted longer.  Maybe I should have check with Amazon to see about repairing it.  But, anyway, I bought the new one and right off the bat, it was disappointing.  #1 it wakes up slower than the old one which is annoying.  I have to swipe it 2-3 times to get it to open up.  #2 it is much too ""sensitive"".  I can hardly old it without it opening the top listings to go to other places in the Kindle.  It is so annoying that it does that.  I have to click on the story section to close it every time it opens up.  My old one never gave me that problem.  #3 it's harder to fined where things are.

First, I never had any reader before. I am a person who barely reads, but have tons of audio books. I prefer to listen. I was thinking about getting kindle a couple years ago, but after going through specifications I was bummed to see it lacks audio books support. I was waiting on when Amazon integrates Audible and maybe mp3 support. While mp3 still not there, audible was added! If you have Amazon prime and audible user and you love to read, or like me hoping to start one day, this is great device to own. Before I tried to read on my tablets or phones, but there is always some distraction, you just switch to other ""interesting"" stuff in your device. Kindle is perfect from this point of view, even ""experimental browser"" pretty annoying to use, so you just read. You open the cover and here is the last page you read. And you keep reading. Not like on the phone. Some complain about power button located on the button. I have not had problem with that. I never had accidental button press.My pros:It is lightIt is simple (no distractions)Great display for readingIt has audible support (all my books in one place)My cons:I wish, that you could listen audio book on background and read at the same time.  It is good when audio file has study book.I wish it supported more book formats, but I guess Amazon wants that you get book only from them, which is understandable.You can add and add features, but it will add weight and make device more complicated and battery hungry.

But it has a bad pixel and the battery seems to need charging more frequently. When I saw the deal to save $40 if I bought it that day, I was tempted to upgrade. But after reading the negative reviews about the battery life, I hesitated.If you read the not-so-fine print, however, you will see that this version is really rated for 21 hours of reading. That is calculated from .5 hours per day for six weeks with wireless off and a light setting of 13. My older Paperwhite has a higher rating of 28 hours based on .5 hours per day for 8 weeks with wireless off and a light setting of 10. I seldom turn wireless on, and my light setting is 19.So, I decided to give it a try hoping that the increase from 212ppi to 300ppi will make it worth it. After it arrives and I have time to try it out, I will update this review, which really isn't a hands-on review but one based on specs at this point.UPDATED Feb 2 2019I just finished my first book on my new Kindle, and I am very pleased with it. The clarity of text is noticeably improved over my previous Paperwhite, and that was the most important factor for me. It is slightly lighter and slightly smaller than my older version. The cover is a teeny big slippery and not as soft as the previous version, but it's fine.As to battery life that people have mentioned, this is what I found. I fully charged it, and over a period of 8 days I read a book that is 256 pages long. The battery is now at 79%. In other words, I used 21% of the battery to read one fairly average sized book. I'm not the fastest reader, and I clearly didn't sit down and read it from start to finish in 2 or 3 hours. I also didn't do any other functions like downloading books or changing collections or anything that would take away from the battery. So, it looks like I could read 4-6 books on one charge, depending on the length of the book. That is more than adequate for my needs.

Not only can you highlight sections of the book you want with your finger tip, the books also make recommendations based on sections that others have highlighted, scary but useful. If you read a lot of reference, historical or similar books, you will find this feature is nice.The speed of the downloads were amazing to me. They were fast, timely and accurate. The selection of books and magazines is amazing. Some of the books I really wanted to buy had ""purchase perks"" (credits toward buying other books, think free) and that sent me into a book buying frenzy of books I have wanted but couldn't justify the hardback cost or space on the shelf in my mind. They are now on my e-reader. I'm sure it could happen but so far no book I have wanted hasn't been available for the kindle e-reader.Being able to set up libraries for the difference books was great. I have 8 sections now for books and like my self library they are separated into areas of interest or relationships. This makes it easier to find any book. You can set it up under titles, authors, or subject matter, which ever you prefer.No matter how many books you have open and reading, every time you start up the kindle e-reader it takes you to the last page you were on before stopping. I like this feature as it's like using an electronic bookmarker. you can easily go to the home page and open a different book if you like. It is easy to turn the pages back or front, go to other pages and even stop reading one book and move to another quickly.  there are a lot of great features you have to see, the dictionary the back lighting, you can change the reading founts style and size.Even better is I can now carry 50 books in my pocket instead of one 3 pound book in my hand when I go to places I know I'm going to have await, dr. office, appointments, kids practices or waiting at the mall. WiFi is not needed to read, just to download and a few other features, so it can go anywhere.I think if we all traded in 30 minutes of  time from texting and video games on the phone or kindle fire for a good read life might be better. Note you can read a lot of these book on your fire as well but the e-reader is specific for reading and no other purpose so it has a lot of better reading settings.",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/R3C8SQLOR04ONE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"January 7, 2019",

There were a couple things the tech found odd -for instance, my country was set to Canada before I even registered (I’m in the US)- but the reset worked somewhat. The page turn hesitation is no longer so lengthy. It’s still not much different and no where near what one would expect (ie not much different than first gen PW). I bumped it up a star for the customer service effort, but I wouldn’t have upgraded my PW with the pin hole defect had I known this wasn’t a real upgrade in abilities.***I’m not sure if the slowness/unresponsiveness is due to a problem with the Paperwhite they sent me or if it’s a case of poor engineering. This kindle is probably even slower than a paperwhite I bought 2 years ago, in fact it reminds me very much of the first gen Kindle I bought in 2007 (and my Newton of the mid-90s with 25k processor was better with text). Whenever I touch the screen on this version, I have to give it at leaat two seconds to react or I’m liable to interrupt the task. Even changing pages seems to require a major kindle effort as it goes blank for a second or more as it needs to refresh the screen. I wouldn’t have bought this if I knew it was so bad but my other paperwhite has an annoying pin prick dot of white in the center of the screen which is distracting (yeah, I know, “1st world problems”, but distracting.) Given that this thing cost 35$ more than that other one (both without “special offers”) I’d expect it to be sharp and crisp and rapid.

After chatting with support because the battery was only lasting three days, they sent me a new paperwhite.  I got the new one,  charged it and after 2 days, the battery was about 25%. I started googling the issue and found the battery lasted 6 wiis, IF YOU SET BRIGHTNESS VERY LOW, TURNED OFF BLUETOOTH AND WIFI AND ONLY USED IT FOR 30 MINUTES A DAY.Basically it lasts 6 weeks if you don't use it. I told the support last week that I had the brightness set at 20, wifi turned on and used it 3 to 4 hours daily. So I got a new one not because the old one was bad but because the support didn't know what he was talking about.I guess I'll have to live with 3 or 4 day battery life.Pros: I really like the light weight. I bought this because of tendinitis in both thumbs and the lightness helps a lot.Cons: Unless i just haven't found it yet, the Kindle app on my Samsung tablet has more features.  THE BIG ONE. The advertisements say that the battery lasts for weeks. I don't know how they figure that unless they don't turn it on for weeks. THE BATTERY LASTED A TOTAL OF THREE DAYS. It was down to 71% after the first day. I don't know if it would save much if I turned off the WiFi or not. I don't have the screen brightness abnormally high.

I was pretty down on my luck the last few years, but my 4 gen kindle (bought for 15$ on CL) has given me so much Joy... this holiday season I am blessed with family and a little extra coin in my pocket.  And I just treated myself to the All new Kindle Paperwhite 32g wifi, with the charcoal case.  It is on the way ... Thanks Amazon!......Well.. that was how excited I was for it.  So far it is pissing me off.  I miss the side buttons of my old kindle, this one feels more like a tablet instead of a kindle.  And once I click a book, its near impossible to get back to the home screen!  The touch screen is terribly unresponsive, and you have to pull down a drop menu to click ""home"" to get back to your home screen.  I tried for several minutes trying to get it to work.. until getting frustrated and putting it down!  Right now I'm hating it, and I already re-gifted my old kindle.  I'm going to give it a few more days, then I'm returning it if it doesn't get any better.The next day I figured out tapping the top of the screen brings down the menu.  The touch screen isn't the best, and I would prefer a button.  But it's still good for reading.  With the backlight on, it uses battery power much faster.  But that's to be expected.  Also it shows your library by thumbnails, I would like the opportunity for it to slow a list view as well.After my negative review, a customer service representative from Amazon called and helped me out with my product.  Asked what I liked and disliked about the item for feedback.Would I buy this again? Yes......  After about a month of usage it has grown in me.  The touch screen still can be a pain, and sometimes jumps forward multiple pages when you try to go back a page.  But that is my only complaint at the moment.  The backlight is extremely useful!  The Kindle is a nice weight and can fit in my back pocket with the Amazon case on it!  I got the Slate greycover for mine.  It's starting to slightly fray on the side already.

Yet  to my frustration I had discovered the hard way just how poor the PDF support is.  Long story short, most PDF documents are simply unreadable on the device without going through some sort of tedious conversion.  You'll be looking at a scaled down image of the page typically.  Converting from PDF to mobi is still experimental at best and mostly results in broken formatting.  The bulky weight I imagine is due to hefty battery side inside, making it much heavier to lug around then your average smartphone.  Organizing large collection of books on the kindle is a painstaking process of pointing and clicking on each book and categorizing it.However, despite it's drawbacks I still think it is far more convenient for reading then laptop or tablet.  Books in mobile formats are absolute hoot to read on the device.  The kindle email address is a nice convenience and does a pretty good job of converting pdf's to Kindle's mobi standard.  Compared to all the online and software alternatives it seems lightyears ahead.  I have not yet tried using the process with epubs yet,  but I'll assume it's a much more straightforward conversion then PDF.  The display is delightfully crisp, while having a backlight is a great addition for reading in dim light.  I did consider getting the cheaper Kindle at first but can attest the backlight makes a huge difference especially in a poorly lit environment.

The upside: it weighs SO MUCH LESS than some actual paperback books, making it easy to carry with me and hold in my hand. It's super thin also.

There is no case with drop protection for the new device, just a leather or cloth cover.I planned to upgrade to the newer version of Kindle Paperwhite specifically because Amazon could not get my collections to sync if I created them online. I had to make collections and add items to them on the device, which was cumbersome. I wanted to be able to create collections (or at least add books to collections) online in my Amazon content and download to device. I was assured by Amazon customer service prior to making the purchase that the newer versions of the Kindle Paperwhite addressed this issue and I would be able to do so. I live in a rural area, so wanted the option of using 3G. However, that added $100 to the price, so I decided to make do with mobile wifi hotspot on my phone. New device arrived, I set it up and registered - slowly, much more so than the old device, which could use 3G. Of 67 collections, 5 downloaded. So, I brought the device to a university with actual wifi the next day. Still only 5 collections downloaded.After 1.5 hours on the phone with Amazon customer service, factory reset, etc., I'm told they will put in a ticket and, after 3 business days, they will move my collections from the old device to the new one.

My other option is to continue making collections on the new device only.No thanks.

The smooth bezel does show fingerprints easily, but it's not a deal breaker. The one issue I have with this version is the battery life. It doesn't come anywhere near the lasting length of the previous Paperwhites. I've had it since October and it has improved a bit, but it lasts about the same amount of time as my Fire HD 8 rather than the stated 6 weeks on the product info. I know that I read more than half an hour a day, so that accounts for some of it, but I'm not reading any more than I did on previous models and with those I rarely had to give a thought to the battery life because it lasted so long. Turning the WiFi off increases the battery life, but then when I want to search for a definition or more info on Wikipedia, it takes more time waiting for the WiFi to connect. This intrudes on my reading...a bit like having someone come and interrupt me while I'm reading.

For people like me, who have many books waiting to be read and may not remember all the titles of these books, it was a disaster.  After about an hour of reading the kindle instruction manual trying to find a simple way to sort current and archived books with no luck, I called kindle customer service.  After calling twice and speaking with 3 representatives including a supervisor, the only way I could separate the books was to download each book and look for the percent number that appeared on the book to show how much of the book was read.  I literally had hundreds of books to go through.  Some I obviously recognized right away as read and archived them, but there were many, many, many that had to be individually downloaded to check for the percentages read - which by the way was NOT always accurate - and it took me hours to complete.My new Kindle works fine, and I getting use to the features. However, the issue of the books in my library all being mixed together, and the customer service representatives who it was obvious were not knowledgeable about this product give this Kindle only 3 stars.

The power button is on the bottom, exactly where your pinky supports the kindle when holding it with one hand. It doesn't matter which hand I hold it with either, my finger will end up bumping the button. Same if you place it on the tray of a treadmill or bike. I had the old kindle keyboard which had a slide to power on/off switch at the bottom which was much better. With this power button you just barely touch it and it powers off. This all could be avoided if the power button was on the top, or if they at least gave the option to flip the screen upside down in the software so you could hold it with the button on top, but the only option for changing the screen orientation is to make it landscape.The other annoying thing is turning the pages one-handed. It's hard to turn the pages forward if you're holding it in your left hand because you have to either contort your left hand to do a swipe or use both hands and tap the right side with your right hand.

They have gotten me through daily commutes, waiting in the Dr's and DMV office, lunchtime breaks and many good hours in the summer spent in the hammock just me and my dog and my Kindle...yes, I am a part of this cold corporate entity's cult..I realize it, and like the crazy people you see being dragged from the jungle by their family from some third rate cult leader...I have no regrets.So... I had a Kindle Voyage and was happy with that until the screen froze and nothing I would do could unfreeze it or shut the Kindle down. Now I had it three years but for a ""premium"" device that is not long...but complaints about that are for another time (note to Amazon, my 6 year old Ipad Mini is going strong after being dropped etc.) I traded in my Voyage for this new version of the Paperwhite and I have to say, this is as good as my ""higher end"" Voyage. Sure it doesn't have the ""etched"" glass  pager turn buttons and as many lights but I do not miss those at all..(I don't really like my Kindle that bright...) and could care less about the page turn buttons, I never used them anyway. This Kindle has a sharp screen and all the lighting you need and while it doesn't have a tapered back like my last one,  really, these things are just made for reading, that is all I need it for and that is exactly what it does. The only thing I wish that it could do was to allow different shades of color to turn the screen, say make the page a more, parchment like brown, (again, like my Ipad does..) or vary the shade of white.Other then that,and Amazon wont like this,  save your money from the Oasis (now that they discontinued the Voyage I was thinking of switching to that one) the Paperwhite quietly does what it is supposed to do, with a great screen and all the light you could need in any situation.

Bluish backlighting....why?,4,Verified Purchase,Digital Storage Capacity: 8Offer Type: With Special OffersColor: BlackOption: Without Kindle Unlimited,"This one is nice over all, lighter than my standard kindle, and I have a large library, so great on the space.I do not like the blue tone to the backlight, and I'm not sure who made such a bizarre decision given that one of several big reasons people use e-readers instead of tablets is to avoid blue light.  Even if it's not the tone that various studies have warned against over the last several years, it's definitely a....lighting that makes me headachey.  Which makes it useless for me for reading in bed without an external source of light.  Seeing as that was one of the reasons I chose this kindle, that is the reason for the docked star.About battery life, which has received several complaints from people ""who have owned kindles since the beginning"".  I'm going to assume that in the past they don't remember the first couple days owning their earlier models, or in the time between the latest models they must've hugely expanded their library.  Because the battery drain is normal the first several days if you have a large library.  It's not a malfunction.  After downloading, even ""asleep"", it's indexing all of those volumes you've just downloaded.  Hence a very swift battery drain.  It won't do that if your library is tiny, or if you don't download a bunch of books at a time.  But if your library is large, it will.  All kindles will.  For that matter, though it's been many years since I've owned an e-reader from the other major competitor, I believe theirs did the same.  It isn't a product flaw.I have to agree with others that the power button on the bottom is a bad design feature, especially off-center.  Where it's at now, if you have it in a stand, it's either inaccessible or else a support ends up against it, powering it off or restarting it as soon as you set it in the holder.  Not going to dock a star for that though since it's fine if it's in most cases.Water-proofing serves me well.

That said, it does everything you really need it to do.  (I haven't bothered with the experimental browser.)The text (an images) are plenty crisp, the Bluetooth range is above average, the Wi-Fi range is fine.  Kindle and Audible store access works as you would expect it.The owner's manual doesn't state it, but in All Settings >> Accessibility >> Invert Black and White, you can in fact switch Black and White, for a negative page.  Bear in mind that it can make images a bit weird, but for night reading (where I kick up the font size one number) it makes things easier on the eyes.For Text To Speech (TTS) you need to activate the VoiceView Screen Reader, go through the tutorial, and learn the command gestures, because the regular command gestures DON'T WORK in VoiceView mode.  It is designed for blind people, to get good use out of a Kindle reader.  I get it that Amazon wants for us Vision-Unchallenged customers to spring for Audible recordings, on top of the actual book.  Well, like most folks, I can't afford to buy a whole pile of books (figuratively) along with the audible recordings at 5 times the cost.  I get the fact that audio books cost a heck of a lot more to produce.  I buy Audible recordings for the books I like the most.  The Aubrey-Maturin novels (Patrick o'Brian) narrated by Simon Vance are absolutely delicious.  But what gets me is that my Kindle Fire can do TTS easily, without activating VoiceView, while my Kindle Paperwhite can't.  The Paperwhite costs more than the Fire, but is less capable.  Go figure.  It wouldn't be difficult to easily implement on the Paperwhite.It does not appear to be able to create Collections for audiobooks.Anyway, the latest Kindle Paperwhite is worth the money, even the 32GB version I own.

I was lured by it being waterproof (which doesn't really mean a lot to me) and 32 Gb of memory vs my old 8 Gb.  I'm not sure the extra storage will do much for me either.  My biggest complaint about the new Kindle is how easy it turns itself off. I read a lot while exercising on an elliptical, treadmill, and stationary bike. I have always liked my Kindles without a cover but this one will turn itself off at the slightest bump or vibration while exercising.  As a result of this defect, I broke down and bought a cover for the thing last week.  So far that seems to have solved the problem but it is annoying that I had to spend another $30  to get rid of a defect designed into the unit.  This Kindle also requires a much harder ""SWIPE"" to get off the power up screen to your reading page.  Swipes forward and backward do not work as well either.  For example, if my mind wanders while reading and I want to go back 4 or 5 screens, swiping right may go backwards but also sometimes just the oppositie occurs and it goes forward instead so that I find myself on a page I thought I had passed already.  Very annoying!!!!  I now find to page backward, it is more consistent to tap the far left of the screen vs my habit of swiping backward.  I am probably being kind giving this Kindle 3 stars as it is vastly inferior to my last 2 Paperwhites.",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/RHCWDSA3X8M3N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"January 9, 2019",

I do not like the changes in user interface and functionality. It takes way too many steps to access your library and pull a book to read - the main screen highlights your wish list and items for sale. Amazon is too focused on repeated selling, and makes it hard to enjoy the things I've already bought from them. I'm not an Alexa user (for security and privacy reasons) so I won't be getting any more Kindle Fires. It's frustrating that the battery starts to go (gets too hot, doesn't hold charge well, etc) that it's easier and cheaper to buy a new device than to replace the battery. I was very happy with my Fire 7, for the most part. In addition - I really dislike the inability to move around (via slider) in the book when it's open. Again, you have to go through several steps to find that option, instead of just having it show up on the bottom of the screen. In contrast, I borrowed an iPad mini and put the Kindle app on it - works great. I'm sure there are things I can't do on it with Amazon that I could on a real Kindle, but mostly it's very easy to set up however you like.",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/R20YYU9XS3CE60/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"January 29, 2019",

I like reading in my bed at night and therefore don't want the room lit up like Christmas.  So far I have been impressed and it does its job well.Pros- Back light helps keep one reading anywhere- Back light can be turned down to give it a more ""classic"" kindle screen and less computer looking screen- longer lasting battery life than previous kindle (although time will tell how this battery will keep a long charge)- Can take a beating (water resistant which makes me more willing to let my kids grab it) through drops and water splashes.  I haven't' tried using it in the tub (who's got time to do that) but they advertise you can.Cons- The font settings take a tiny bit longer to get too than my previous kindle (but not a huge deal)- Takes a bit longer to wake up than my last kindleOverall these are great to have with you on trips, DMV's, or other places you need to kill time or simple want to enjoy a plenthra of reading choices.",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/R1WP7YL2GVMROH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"March 4, 2019",

Lighter. It doesn't have the heft the other PW has.2. Smaller. The whole frame is smaller, and it doesn't sacrifice screen-size.3. More storage. I could have done with the 8 GB, but my beloved wife got me the 32 GB.4. As a disclaimer, I do not yet have the dead pixel or USB cable issue others have had.5. Waterproof. I took my older PW to Hilton Head over the summer but was always worried about getting it close to the water. Not an issue with this model. Jellyfish are still an issue though, but I digress.6. Bluetooth and Audible integration, although this could be done just as easily with a cell-phone.What I don't like...1. Although it has more LED's, my older PW is actually noticeably brighter when they are both set to the same light level (See photo... light set to 12 on both devices... older PW is on the left... the new one is on the right).2. A little slow touch response, compared to the old PW. And you have to mean it. No soft tapping, but almost like pushing a button. Makes swiping a pain, because half the time it registers as a touch and you end up opening a book or collection when you wanted to swipe to the next page.3. Battery life... Non-existent... I haven't had time to measure how well the battery is during normal reading, but while I was downloading all my books and setting it up, it killed the battery 3 times in a day. Of course, downloading hundreds of books within a 24 hour period is unusual power drain, and will only need to be done once during initial setup. But still. Maybe Amazon will incorporate something into a software update that manages power consumption better.Unless you have Audible books, or have so many books that 4 GB is not enough, then moving to this reader is fairly lateral. I don't use Audible, so that is just a thing for me now. But that may change in the future.If this is your first Kindle, it is still a great device.

Just not certain that it's for me.I had an old Kindle keyboard that finally gave out so I replaced it with a $30 sale price Kindle Fire. I read a lot of history and biography and liked that photographs were rendered in crisp, clear color. Also liked that I could set the background to sepia, which lessened eyestrain. I'm a heavy reader and go through 3-4 books per week so battery life became an issue and decided to get a Paperwhite to read from while charging the Kindle Fire.My first issue when I received the Paperwhite was the rubbery backing as I have a latex allergy. Sent a tweet to Amazon asking if any latex was used in the backing and was surprised to get an answer within 10 minutes that the backing is latex-free. Perhaps this should be noted somewhere on the description as this isn't an uncommon allergy but good on Amazon to give me such a fast answer.The Paperwhite itself is okay. Can't adjust the background color, which I'd expected. The smaller screen size, though, has me turning pages much faster than on the 7"" Kindle Fire which gets a little tiresome as I'm a fast reader. So far I'm happy with the battery life, though, which was my main purpose in buying it. The compact size is handy to toss in a handbag if I'm traveling so that's also a positive.

My earlier Paperwhite came on instantly.  This one has a long ""waking up"" period each time the cover is opened.  That issue alone, had I been aware of it, would have kept me from springing for the new model, but there are two other issues:My old Kindle never crasned.  Not once in five years.  This one crashed twice the first week.  Finally, the cable connection is different and finnicky.  for reasons I don't understand, it is very difficult to connect the charging cable to the new model.Bottom line: if you have an older Paperwhile, my advice would be to hang on to it unless the waterproofing is a big deal for you or you need more memory.

That's approximately the 2nd Gen; it was whatever the number is for the first one with a background light. I don't remember the number. This is mainly a review of the differences I perceive with the new one.I really like it.The light is far more uniform, and seems brighter, but the brightness might be an illusion; I don't know.The better resolution lets me use a smaller font and still read it without reader glasses, which is a big deal for me. And: the image display of book covers is can actually be used, instead of showing little more than a set of muddy blobs.It's also much more responsive to touches on the screen. Not overly so - I don't pop multiple pages forward (well, usually :-)), but faster to do its thing, whatever was requested. Entering text is much easier, but I don't do that very often so not a big deal.

This one is nice and I love the bigger memory, bluetooth feature and Audible support.  Great, and log overdue features.  It is slightly slimmer than the prior versions.  Instead of a sunken screen, it is one uniformly flat face, which included the screen.  There is a design flaw, IMO, in that it is not 100% flat.  The corners of the reading screen have a slight dip, which causes a non-removable bubble in any screen protector you may add.  I have tried two and they both have bubbles in the same places.  These do not interfere with the readability of the actual body of the text, however, it is annoying to see every time I look at the screen and annoying that it is not possible to have a protector for this without bubbles, which have nothing to do with how the protector is applied, but the cause is the design of the kindle.  The prior versions, having a sunken screen, was better in that being sunken was automatically a screen protection.  Also, I did have a protector on it, and it was basically bubble free as no corner issues existed.  I do not think this is a defective unit, but simply how these are built as the device works great and I do very much like it...

It works well, and does everything like it should. Couple of items I thought I would mention- 8 gb of storage is deceiving. The OS is larger than my previous Voyage; I presume this is because of Audible and Bluetooth support. I have just two or 3 books on mine, and I have 27gb free out of 32gb; the OS must be taking up the lions share of the space.  8gb seems like it is more space but for practical purposes, it's not.

Pressing the button manually is much quicker. My speculation is that the delay is built in for the cover on, so that if jostled in motion it doesn't power on/off constantly, like my Voyage used to.

I also like the whole concept of an e-book simply because so many books fit in so small a space.  On the negative side, these issues: 1) After all these years Kindles still do not show a correct percentage-remaining indicator if you are reading a book with appendices, such as a histories or biographies.  I reached the end of the last book I read, to my surprise, at something like 72% completed (the other 28% being footnotes and bibliography).  It would be nice to know how far one has to go in the text the author intended everyone to read. 2) Maps and photos in the Paperwhite render poorly.  I have ended up opening Kindle books on my smart phone reader when I want to look at pictures or maps because the images on the Paperwhite are too grainy to sort out if they involve any detail or small writing.  However, for straight text, the Paperwhite it is just fine.  3) Most of the touch screen is one big ""page forward"" trigger, which means you have to keep your hands quite close to the edge to avoid inadvertent page turning and be very intentional when attempting to back up a page -- so it can't really be held as one might hold a book.  Being able to adjust those areas or desensitize some of the areas would be great -- I have inadvertently advanced to the next page quite a few times.  4) Some books make liberal use of footnotes that the author plainly intends the reader to read along with the text -- using them as a sort of entertaining side commentary.  However, in the Paperwhite it is not easy to trigger the footnote-reader reliably; attempts to touch the footnoted number on the screen will sometimes show the footnote, other times turn the page, and still other times result in a Wikipedia-like definition for the particular footnote number itself (say an exegesis on the number 1).  Overall, while the Paperwhite is an improvement over my ancient DX, I was expecting more advancement in the reader experience in the 10 years or so since they were first introduced.

I will never expect the battery life to last for a week. I read each and every day. The backlight chews up battery life, it always will. To me that's not bad it just the way it is. Apple has done a remarkable job giving the iPad an 8-10 battery life. The retina display and the color really eats up the battery. I'm saying that to say, I have very real expectations about battery life. This Kindle fits within those parameters for me.I also own a Fire but I like my iPad better. To me the Paperwhite Kindle fits the bill for what I like in an e-Reader. My only beef is that it runs slow. Most of the time when I'm trying to page through my books (looking for one in particular) it will Open one instead of moving to the next page. It treats the swipe like I tapped to open a book.

I have to charge it about every 2 days, which means that when I go into the hospital next week, I'll have to take my charging cord. And that same cord, which had to be replaced because the first one wouldn't go in, is very hard to insert into the slot or pull out. Because of that, I'm downgrading my rating to 3 stars.

I'm new to e-readers, but figured there must be some way to deactivate this feature.  So, in addition to posing the question on this review site, I also inquired with Amazon's Kindle ""Device Support"" folks, who told me the feature couldn't be turned off.  I was surprised by their answer and couldn't imagine that my complaint was an isolated one, but took them at their word.Fast forward a few weeks later when I'm reading my first e-book on the Kindle.  Still finding this feature extremely annoying, I decided to do an internet search and, lo and behold, quickly found a posting about it on redd it.  A very helpful poster explained that the feature involved is ""Page Refresh"" and can be turned off from the home page by clicking on the 3 dots in upper right hand corner, followed by clicking on ""Settings"", ""Reading Options"" and then turning off ""Page Refresh"".

Amazon, why, why, why can you not just make the actual screen on this larger and the bezels smaller?! The huge black frame on this is just such unnecessarily wasted space!! It would make this the #1 perfect reading device if you could just update that! Maybe think about that for the next gen Paperwhite!

No more noticeable shadows on the screen if you’re reading in a dark room with the backlight on.-Not exactly a pro but battery life seems to be on par with the last generation. I think that the people complaining about this don’t realize that after you download a bunch of books (like you would do when you buy a new kindle) your kindle has to index all those books which can take several days and eats up a lot of processing power. Note, if you want to see if your kindle is still indexing just do a search from the home screen for a nonsense word like awffsff. If your results show “text in books” highlighted with a number following it that means your kindle still has to index that many books.Con:-The only drawback I can see with this one is that since the screen material is edge to edge it acquires a lot more fingerprints.

This is done where the audio can ONLY be heard via a Bluetooth device.  I believe that this is so since the addition of a headphone jack might compromise the waterproofing of the Kindle; also a very nice feature. However, given that it is only through a Bluetooth device can the audio be heard, I would have expected that the implementation of the Bluetooth capability be better. For example, using the device in a vehicle is poorly done. First, once the device is connected to the vehicle, the vehicle IS listed as one of the registered and recognized Bluetooth devices.  The problem is once you leave the vehicle and return later. The Kindle does not seem (for me at least) to automatically reconnect to the car's Bluetooth. I have to manually reconnect it. While this may not sound like much of an inconvenience, it really gets annoying over time. My cell phone automatically reconnects to my car when I return to it. In fact, if I had been listening to an audiobook using the Audible app, once back in the car, the app automatically reconnects to the car, and the book resumes playing at the point I had left off. It would be great if this simple task could work the same way with my kindle. Having to open the Bluetooth dialog box, touch the connection to the car in the list, then get asked if I want to connect or forget the car, then after clicking on 'connect' the device connects. I then have to hit the play button to resume play. Again, while trivial in one regard, having to do this EVERY time is annoying. The only time the Kindle resumes automatically is if I turn the car off, leave the kindle in the car for a few minutes, then restart the car and only then will the device remain connected and the audiobook resume.  Since the Audible App on the phone works so nicely, I am surprised that the same functionality in the Kindle does not.But, I am glad that I CAN use my kindle for Audible listening since my phone can be annoying for this in its own way; everytime a call or text comes in, the audiobook playback is interrupted when I am using my phone in the car for Audible listening. I suppose that I should consider this a trade-off; no text or call interruptions to my book, but I have to pay for that by the necessity of re-connecting my Kindle to the car manually every time I get back in.The other minor issue is having to go to 'Home', then ""My Library"" then having to choose from Book to Audiobook in the listing of assets on the device is a tad cumbersome. At least, my most recent book and most recent audiobook are shown on the homescreen so a minimal amount of navigation is needed to return to either.All in all, the screen is very nice, the lighting is more even than on my earlier 5th gen paperwhite, the fonts are nice, and having Audible onboard is nice, and of course, the waterproofing (not absolute, but good enough for casual reading by the pool) is quite a plus for folks like me who live in Florida and are never far from the water.For the sake of completeness in this review, I must also add my two cents on the resizing of the device. It is only FRACTIONALLY smaller than the previous generations of Paperwhite devices, so the size difference is not really noticeable; that is until one tries to reuse a cover from a previous Kindle. The 10th gen device is just enough smaller that covers for earlier devices will not work with this generation, so another expenditure is required for a cover; an expenditure not really compensated by a reduction in size of the device, since the difference is utterly unnoticeable outside of having to get a new cover.",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/R26C0JAGYDX0UR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"March 21, 2019",

For me it really was an upgrade, as I wanted a waterproof device and the Bluetooth/Audible support was an added bonus. I never really cared for the page turn sensors on my Voyage, as I found the edges too thin and therefore a bit uncomfortable/awkward to use. The lighting on my new Paperwhite is even (unlike my Voyage which had uneven blues) and, while the glass screen has a slightly different micro-etched finish than my old Voyage (Voyage has more of a “paper” feel) the screen is equally free of glare. The 300dpi is on par; however, with the even lightening of my new Paperwhite, I’d rate the screen better than my old Voyage. Add the bonus that I don’t have to have a brief moment of panic each time one of my five children jump in the pool while I’m reading (as with my Voyage), and I absolutely LOVE this new Kindle. I also read a lot in bed at night and even though the blue lights of my Voyage don’t cause the eye strain a tablet of smartphone would cause, the light could still distract my wife when she was sleeping.

Always keep something you can wipe the screen with because it smudges something awful. Amazon still don't offer soft/warm light [ shame on them ] and this device has one more light then the old one but is a lot less bright,I never went over setting 12 in brightness on the old one and here I'm never below 14.Going from a great tablet to an e reader takes some getting used to when it comes to respond times, whether it is turning pages, browsing or God forbid having to use their browser to go online, an outright awful experience.All the commands are made from the top witch is the opposite of every tablet and app out there.Over all this is not an instead of item but an extra goddie.

The previous generations did not do this. Second, the kindle as a whole really attracts and shows fingerprints. The smallest tap (which happens every time I turn the page...) creates a fingerprint. This is also something that did not happen with the previous generations. It’s quite frustrating considering the whole interaction with the e-reader is fingertip based.The only reason I am not returning this product is because I got it on sale and the previous generations remain more expensive (which is also curious...).

Kindles Keep Getting Worse,1,Verified Purchase,Digital Storage Capacity: 8Offer Type: With Special OffersColor: BlackOption: Without Kindle Unlimited,"This is my fourth Kindle, and I think my last one - I'm going to try another ereader instead next time. Why? Because they keep getting worse - features are taken away. My first Kindle had 3G AND WiFi. My latest - the Voyage, which I loved dearly - had haptic page turning buttons, so you could read with either hand. This paperwhite is awful. It's VERY slow to open (even though I have almost nothing on it), slow to turn pages, the touchscreen-only means that you can only read it turning pages with your right hand fingers. I find it awkward, even with a (very nice) cover). And then just the things that are increasingly annoying about the Amazon reading experience - constant ads, no easy way to organize your books, often books you own don't appear in search, the store is a mess and cluttered with self-published crap. If you're a big reader, like I am - 3 books or so a week - then seriously - TRY SOMETHING ELSE. I was excited that this is waterproof because my last Kindle was destroyed when my small child upended a waterbottle on it. Beach reading! Bath reading! But honestly, the experience is so annoying that I've returned to paper books from the library as much as possible.

Indexing is still a nightmare and if you load a lot of books... back up... even if you load 15 books, like I did, indexing still runs as a snails pace. So don't expect to load all your books without any issues.Another gripe I have is the glorious 8GB it promises is reduced to under 6GB when you receive the device. This is not really a major issue, but 2GB for the OS is quite a lot of storage being utilized. 6GB is still a nice chunk to play with, if you can just get past that accursed indexing! Someone mentioned a workaround that will disable indexing entirely but you still get to search normally, so I might try that.The device feels nice and I can definitely tell the difference from my previous 1st gen Paperwhite which I bought when it debuted in 2012. This is a welcome replacement for a tired, broken down, battery draining PaperWEIGHT device, which I still loved but found it was time for an update and upgrade. I like that the 10th gen now no longer have the raised bezel and is now flush with the screen. That is what I wanted from the start, but it was not an option when the first one came out.I will keep checking the indexing on my meager 15 books I loaded and see if it has made any progress in about an hour. For a new device that is supposed to be better than the previous models, I feel like all the new Paperwhite is is a new shell covering the same old OS and same old hardware inside because of this accursed indexing that seems to never finish. Amazon REALLY needs to update this feature to give us a progress bar on each book being indexed so we know which book is the culprit in slowing down the device and causing major battery drain.All in all, it's overpriced for what all you get. I feel that maybe Amazon could get by on selling this device for about 60-70 dollars and still come out on top.** EDIT **Well, I have had a few days to play with the all new Paperwhite and I have to say, nothing has changed except that things have gotten worse. The battery life is as bad as an Apple device. It's dying quickly and I am hardly using it. Nothing is indexing as I have checked several times, restarted the device several times to check if there are any items indexing and nothing is. The battery is dying for some reason and I have no idea why. If this thing is supposed to last a month on one charge, then that is a flat out lie. I doubt this device will last the week without needing to be charged again.The only thing I can do is reset the device (I have already updated the software to the more recent OS) and put everything back on.... again! and see if that fixes the battery life. I have already reset the device a couple times already before I really started to put books on it but I guess I can try again on the new software I had to sideload. The battery is at 92%, dropping from 100% hardly being used. I suppose I will have to live with it since I am in Thailand and sending this back would be too much of a hassle as I have to go through my dad back home, then he has to send it back and then Amazon will have to send a new one as this one is certainly defective and then spend the money to send it back to me again. I just don't want to go through that hassle. I will edit this review again with my findings, but I have changed the three stars to one and rightfully deserved.

I mainly used the Paperwhite to read at night because reading from my phone kept me up with the blue back-light.I just received this new version a few days ago and was excited to be able to read in a pitch black room again.

Highlighlighting is gray, books in the store are in grayscale, recipes have gray food pictures. I am very disappointed. I like color in my life. Also, it used to be easy to bookmark a page; now it is a multistep process and other features I am accustomed to, seem to be gone.

The backlight is automatically on when the device powers on for the first time, however, there's the option of turning it off entirely.- A noteworthy design change is that the screen now sits flush against the black border.

During that time I began to notice a gradual sluggishness and slowdown of performance, typical with aging electronic devices.  So when Amazon offered a 25% trade-in discount along with a $25 gift card for a new Kindle, with more memory, newer longer lasting battery, and waterproofing, I thought ""Why Not?""  Like other users, I checked out the reviews first, I and could not understand the snipping about battery life issues, system slowness issues, screen contrast problems, and a sensitive on-off button.  Undeterred I returned my old Kindle by UPS, and within a couple of weeks the new Kindle arrived, along with a new Amazon fabric cover that I'd ordered.I'm very pleased to report that this is by far the best Kindle Paperwhite yet.  The new software took a couple of days to get used to, as the menus for accessing all the features and adjustments are different.  There is plenty of battery life, in fact more than my old Kindle.  I read several hours a day and have yet to go below 50% in a week's time.  It's nothing to plug it in at night as I do my cell phone when needed.  The on-off button at the base of the Kindle is not as sensitive as reported by some.  The Kindle reacts immediately when the case is opened.  It even tells you when it is waking up from a deep sleep state, and lets you know when to swipe to unlock the device.  Amazon's lightly textured fabric case makes the Kindle a delight to hold and protects it from bumps and dirt.  The display is clean and crisp, with adjustable contrast, and a good selection of fonts to choose from for easy reading in the size of your choice.  Unlike some users, I don't keep hundreds (or thousands) of books on my Kindle.  That's what Amazon's cloud storage is for!  If it's that important I usually buy a hard copy book for my home library.The day I got my Kindle I plugged it in to give the battery a full 24 hour charging cycle.  Meanwhile I turned on the Kindle and was pleased to see that it was already registered to my Amazon account!  While it was charging I went on line to make sure the Kindle was updated with the current software, which I downloaded and installed.  The only small negative is that my old kindle was preloaded with Sudoku Works, yet the new version would not support the game, or any game for that matter.

Not only does Wikipedia contain much, much misinformation but it is involved with censorship of accurate content.  I don't want it popping up when I want to look up a definition.  The Paperwhite display is black and white and most book artwork shown in black and white is pretty blah and hard to read. When I look up the definition of a word, the dictionary font tends to be smaller than I'm comfortable with and doesn't match the font size used for the book text. Perhaps there is a way to control this but I haven't found it yet.On the positive side:  I switched from a low end Fire to the Paperwhite.  The Paperwhite is lighter and much easier to handle. Navigation from page to page can be done by a tap on the left or right side of the screen - much less distracting than having to swipe. On my Fire I couldn't read with direct sunlight on the screen. The Paperwhite is amazingly EASIER to read in direct sunlight and the non-glare surface doesn't send back annoying background reflections like the FIre did.  The reading time before the unit has to be recharged is way beyond what I experienced with the Fire.  The settings most likely to be adjusted while reading are intuitive and very easy to access.  At first I thought the Paperwhite was pretty small, but after using it for a while I found the size wasn't a problem and the portability was great.",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/R2I5J9YN1N3LPW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"March 5, 2019",One

I also don't really need it for audio books since my phone is smaller and more convenient.I'd give my last Paperwhite 5 stars, and this one only 4 because Amazon instituted a wake mode so it takes longer to get to the book than with the old one.

I only use my Fire for eBooks and I liked the promise of water resistance, longer battery life and additional storage. When I got my new device, I was sincerely disappointed. The experience reading a book is great. The text is crisp and clean and you can move from one page to the next easily.  Unfortunately, getting to the book is somewhat painful. Opening the home screen, taking any kind of action or viewing menu items is painfully slow. The screen also flashes several times as if it’s struggling to render. I had similar behavior while navigating to the menu from within the book or bookmarking a page. I haven’t seen this reported in other reviews so maybe my expectations are too high after reading with a Fire, but after two devices exhibiting the same behavior I have to assume it’s working the way it’s supposed to.Overall, it felt like I was using a decades old device rather than the newest Kindle. The experience was so bad that I thought it had to be malfunctioning and asked technical support to send me a replacement. The second device was just as bad.

I don’t necessarily think it’s worth the full price you pay, so I’d try to get one on a big sale. I got mine because I’m a very avid reader, and I was tired of reading on my phone. I was also about to go on a 16 hour road trip in a few weeks so I needed something to read on other than my phone. I like this much better than reading on a phone or tablet because it’s less straining on my eyes. It’s also not as bright in complete darkness so you don’t disturb others around you if they’re trying to sleep. I also really like the fact that this version comes with audible and can be paired with Bluetooth headphones. HOWEVER — and this is a pretty big deal to me — the charge for this device does not last “weeks” as they claim. Especially not if you read a lot. It might last one week, maybe a week and a half if you’re not using it. I also find it really annoying that the button on the bottom can be pushed so easily. I don’t yet have a case on mine, so when I put it in my book bag any sort of shift or movement can apply pressure to the button and cause the screen to come on. Soooooo, I guess I have to get a case.

This is by far the worst of them. It seems to be following a trend with the kindle product line in the last three years. The voyage was incredibly good. First round of the oasis, pretty good. Second Oasis was definitely a regression being so slippery and unwieldy. I thought this, being the newest, would reflect all the lessons they've learned about making effective e-readers over the course of their history. This was totally wrong.1. The power button, as every one has mentioned is positioned terribly and is very sensitive. It turns off when I'm reading it, and turns on when I put it into my bag. To add salt to the wound, you cannot even rest it upright against something if you want to read while doing something else with your hands (e.g. have a meal), since it will hold down the power button.2. The battery life is terrible, and has only gotten worse despite being only a few months old. This week I've charged it fully four times, after reading about 4 hours a day. Somehow charged it to 50% this afternoon, read a couple of hours, brought it home, and it had died.3. The touchscreen seems much worse than my previous kindles, and I find myself mis-highlighting all the time, and needing to try footnote links many times before it jumps to the footnote rather than page turning.4.

I believed her, bought it and just rerceived it on Tuesday....It worked immediately!  It is fantastic!  I love it.  I have had absolutely no problems with anything.

However, if you read at night in bed like I do, you will be disappointed.Even at the lowest brightness setting with the colors inverted (black background white text), the Kindle is far too bright to read in the dark. Previous Kindle versions (the Voyage in particular) would allow one to set a very low brightness and slowly decrease it as his or her eyes adjusted to the darkness. This is very helpful for people who have issues falling asleep (like me!) and who do not want to turn on an outside light in the room because they don't want to wake a sleeping partner (like me!). This new Kindle version's lowest brightness setting is bright enough to keep me awake and feeling restless rather than drift me off to sleep. It's so bright I can use it as a flashlight in my room, something the old versions could never do. I went through a lengthy process with customer support and they basically just said sorry, there might be a firmware update that allows lower brightness settings, but no timeline for its release.Too bad, I guess I need to continue with the older versions until then if I want to continue my nighttime reading.",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/RR0A2N1MT9XAD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"April 24, 2019",One

I am so happy to now have both capabilities in a single device that lets me focus on reading without interruptions from app notifications.  Plus it's small enough to hold in one hand!  Makes it really easy to read in bed while lying on my side, something I struggled with when using the iPad.  The controls are really intuitive, easy to access and provide you with great control over your library, although I would love to have a way to sort the books in my library by percentage complete.  A battery charge lasts me for a couple of weeks before needing a recharge and that's with using it at least 2-3 hours a days.  I've had this device for only a couple of months now but I'm hoping to get just as much value out of it as my old one.",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/R3UGN1G4NI7WQL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"March 10, 2019",One

Well.... I got that and much more. First let me say that it is a gift from my son and daughter-in -law. If I had purchased it myself I would most certainly return it. It is too complicated. The touch screen is very slow to respond if at all. It doesn't hold a charge. Everything is done on screen including turning pages. First you have to find the menu bar which is hidden until you tap on the top of the screen. Then you wait and wait.... After a few hours on the phone with a very helpful person from Kindle I'm no better off. All the options are hidden. You have to select symbols and hope they open after you tap the screen.

Overall I would say given the state of electronic devices available in general it’s about average.  Given the cost of memory I have to say that I think the item is overpriced. I have had trouble with previous Kindles dying  on me after moderate use so I’m not sure how long I’ll get use out of the one I just bought. The primary benefit I get from the Kindle is being able to magnify the text because of my failing eyesight but other than that very considerable benefit I really don’t find it to be a terribly  remarkable piece of equipment. I have to say whenever I do business with Amazon I feel as though I am colluding with a corporate monster  because I have read so much reliable information about how much Amazon does to destroy the small businesses and create an overwhelming monopoly that kills entrepreneurship.,B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/R3JH8Y1FU63DQ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"March 16, 2019",

At first look out of the package the battery was reading 97% and dropped to 95% in just about 30min of playing around with it. I stuck it on a charger for about 20 min and it showed 100% I haven't plugged it in since. I got this kindle on 02/12 its been 12 days and I haven't plugged it in once. I read on it every day for at least an hour and some days for 4 or 5 hours at a time, I haven't disconnected it from the Wifi and the screen brightness has been at about 75% or setting 18 which is plenty bright to read with in direct sunlight. The Battery is currently showing 54% after all that use and I for one couldn't be happier. Now the bad... to be honest all the things I don't like about it are simply preference things like it doesn't show the book progress bar like my kindle fire does unless you open up the multiple page view for going through the book quickly but not reading, That's kind of annoying. I have big hands (wear an XL glove) but the device itself is too wide to manipulate easily with one hand. Also accessing the settings menu is actually too easy, I wish amazon had made it a swipe down but instead you just touch anywhere in about the top inch and a half of the screen and the menu opens this is annoying because sometimes the settings menu opens when I was just trying to turn the page. also wish it wasn't all black and white but I know that's a trade off for battery performance so I can't be too mad about that. All in all its a pretty amazing little e-reader and I couldn't be happier with the experience of using it, its become my new go to device and I've got at least 4 to choose from. Good Product worth every penny.(side note: I am not a professional reviewer, I did not get paid to review this product nor did I receive a discount of any kind on it I paid full price and just wanted anyone on the fence about buying it to know how good it is, and some of the downsides.

However, instead of the usual black Kindle logo, the new Paperwhite has a distracting,  conspicuous white logo.

I hope in the next iteration they revise this and consider a less eye-catching way to promote the Kindle. Besides this, I tend to agree with what others have already noted:- The battery life is considerably less than previous generation due to additional LED and bluetooth hardware.- The new Paperwhite seems to have grey-er black than the previous generation, slightly reducing text legibility.- The included usb cable can be difficult to attach to the kindle, hopefully next iteration would have USB-C.Overall, the new Paperwhite has some good improvements, but it doesn't really offer a significant reason to upgrade.

This purchase was made to replace a much older Kindle which I believe was similar in thickness and weight. As to the increased memory? I agree with just about everyone else, who cares?

I have been using my new paperwhite for a month or so now and love it just as much as my last one. I read several reviews that talked about seeing bright spots, or light issues, I have not experienced either of these. It is just a little lighter than my last one, but not enough to make it noticeable, plus I keep mine in a case that has a reading kickstand to read hands free on lunch break, so the size difference is not noticeable at all to me.

My first and only other dedicated eReader was a Sony eReader about a decade ago.  As an avid reader, I was immediately sold on the idea of being able to carry ALL of my books around in a space smaller than a single book.  Sure, you had to plug it into a computer to get content on it, but it was still a lot easier than going to the library or bookstore.  Maybe the contrast wasn't perfect for all lighting, maybe it was a little slow, but from the day I got that eReader, I have transitioned to where it's pretty tough to get me to buy a physical book.  When Sony got out of the eReader biz, my next step was to a tablet or phone with Kindle app, other book apps, and any other apps I wanted.  Best of both worlds, right?  Sometimes, yeah, but not always.  Impossible to read at the beach or pool.  My wife actually snapped a picture of me by a resort pool with towel draped over me and my tablet so I could read.  So I finally bit the bullet and got only my second dedicated eReader ever, and I'm ecstatic.  Of course, I can download books directly (over wifi, but where can't you get wifi nowadays?), it integrates Audible and allows you to switch seamlessly between reading and listening via Bluetooth,. but best of all?  I can not only see it clearly in direct light or complete darkness, it's even waterproof so it's perfect for the pool!  If you want lots of apps, color screens, and the internet, get a tablet.  If you want the best reading experience pretty much anywhere, get the Paperwhite.

I'm going to leave my original review in case anyone has a similar problem, so you'll know what to try: ""I bought this as a Christmas present to myself and it worked really well at first. I do like the lighting. But after about a month, the battery stopped keeping charge. After being charged to 100% at night, it would be down to 15% the next morning - and this happened several times. Unfortunately I'm not in a position to return it, so am stuck with this expensive reader that I can't take anywhere, and actually can't even use at home unless it's plugged in. It's possible of course that it's just this one ... but for anyone considering it, just make sure you're able to return it before you buy.""",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/R14OII7ZGXFFIQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"February 5, 2019",One

I love my kindle.  If you took it away I would be devastated.  Doesn't matter that I can read on my phone or tablet.  My kindle is my friend.It is always difficult to adjust to the upgrades in any software.  My previous kindle- not a paperwhite- was like wearing my favorite sweater.  I now have a paperwhite and after I turn it on, the resemblance gets fuzzy.It is annoying that the books come up with suggestions.  I don't mind that on my phone, but when I open my kindle, I am there to read.  I don't want all that -- on my kindle.  I have learned to turn the library into a list instead of having icons.  If you look at the icons, it is hard to see the title of the book!!  I am there to read.What I really do not like.  I hate swiping to page forward.  I hate tapping to page forward.  If you are holding the kindle with your left hand, you can't tap to page forward.  If you swipe, you need two hands.One of the things that got me off the physical books and made me love the kindle was that I can lay in bed and hold the kindle with one hand and hit that page forward button.  One handed operation.  That is gone for me.  Having the touch screen often results in the book jumping to a page by accident and then you have to figure out what page you are on.  It is soooo irritating.  It makes me sad because I loved my previous kindle.  After the dog got it...... I was forced to get the new one.I am actually angry that that button is gone.  I think you need a hybrid.  And after you design it you should give me one for free.  I continue to try to acclimate to my new paperwhite, but it is hard to give up convenience, for what the new hot technology is.  Because sometimes, the new hot technology is flawed.",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/R155GHV8WZZVPO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"January 27, 2019",

Now starting it up to see if it works any better than the original. Will report back later.---UPDATE-2, January 3, 2019: 24 hours later and I have been trying to get this new PaperWhite to work as advertised. I can simply say: No Joy. Frankly, I'm so sorry about this as I had asked for this specific gift for some time; although, I have never owned a stand alone Kindle device - only the apps on my computers (as noted above.) This second replacement exhibits the same problems as the original one. It is very slow, the touch screen doesn't work all the time and the turning of pages and/or going to the home screen (or elsewhere) still is extremely laggy with the screen blinking, doing the white/black-> black/white bounce and taking forever. Again, this simply cannot be ""book related"" as this happens with any number of my books INCLUDING the two (2) Kindle User Guides included with the machine.I'm now going to get back with Customer Service and request a return/refund as I just can't do this anymore.My recommendation: If you have any type of portable device that will run the excellent Kindle APP use that. My Kindle apps all work flawlessly across all my portable devices including my iPhone. Skip the Kindle hardware as it offers nothing to the serious reading experience.",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/RNHDXXYYM1TO1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"December 26, 2018",

It made me grumpy. Some of that is because of the lower content and quality level of the Paperwhite vs the Voyager, and some of that is design choices for the Paperwhite (given its cost constraints) that just seem non-ideal.1) My most comfortable position for holding it puts my pinkie finger right on the power button. I’ve only had the thing 12 hours and already accidentally shut it off mid-read several times.  (This was NEVER a problem before.). Edited to add: a brilliant friend pointed out that I could hold the thing upside down to read so that the button would be on top, away from my hand. This would be great if it worked, but the screen doesn’t seem to flip on the Paperwhite.2) For some reason, I now have to choose between seeing only my collections (without knowing which books are unsorted into collections) or all my collections and all my (70 pages of) books, which makes finding and sorting stuff much much harder.  (Before a book was either in a collection, or unsorted and visible outside the collections. Much much more useful.)3) The Voyager has hardware buttons with tactile feedback, the Paperwhite has only screen touches to navigate. I miss the hardware.4) There is no way to tap to move both forward and backward with a single hand (as I now realize I did ALL THE TIME on my Voyager). You can swipe back, which would be okay except...5) The screen is under-responsive to swipes (which was also the case on the Voyager, but it mattered less because of both the hardware buttons and the better screen touch navigation zones).6) I loved the feature on my old Voyager where the brightness auto-audjusted to the ambient light (nice and bright outside on a sunny day, dimmed to a peaceful level in bed at night). That’s not on the Paperwhite. I miss it.7) Overall the thing feels cheaper and less nice than the Voyager.  Which is maybe not surprising - it does cost less than the Voyager.  But I wish my Voyager hadn’t died an ignominious death of screen lines and cycling power. Or that Amazon hadn’t killed the Voyager (presumably in favor of the Oasis, which costs $50 more than the Voyager did).",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/R1XVGXGVVT3TBF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"April 4, 2019",

At that time, it would only give me one month free.  I called customer service and after a very long conversation, a ""ticket"" was created and they promised to resolve the problem.  I waited three weeks and called again today.  The person on the phone was unable to help, so I tried the chat feature.

I finally succumbed, lured by the promise of 25% off plus a generous trade-in allowance and the rationalization that I needed a new case and would like a version without the annoying special offers. I filled out the trade-in paperwork and was granted an instant $50 credit that would be finalized after they received my trade-in. My Kindle had been in a hard shell case since purchase; the screen was perfect, there was nothing wrong with it and it was just as Amazon sold it to me (and described in their offer) Nevertheless, when they received it, they told me it was worth only $5, and since I had checked the wrong box on the offer, they could not return it to me.  I was furious, and felt misled and abused. But instead of having a futile conversation on the phone, decided I would just post a review instead and warn others to beware of unconditionally accepting a trade-in offer from Amazon. I am a business writer; Amazon's first stated corporate principle is customer obsession; pretty sure this principle was not used in my case. I have been a great customer for years; have more than 500 books in my Kindle library and I am an Amazon Prime member, and buy and ship stuff all the time.  I will now be reevaluating all my choices, I am so disappointed in them. It's not the $50, it's the deceptive nature of the practice. They knew everything about my Kindle since I'd bought it from them; to offer me $50 and then give me $5 is totally unacceptable and truly shook my faith in what I had regarded as a great company. Hope the $45 was worth it to them. On a practical note, I had several issues many Kindle users may be familiar with - my library did not transfer over; the only way I could do it was to select books I wanted to download and then download them. They do not show whether you have read them or not in your online library, so had to transfer all of them, and now will have to sort through. They also gave me a new send to Kindle email that took a while for me to figure out and change back.

You can do everything this reader does on your cell phone already.  It is hard to use, black and white screen, jerky motion, battery life is better than a cell phone, but not what is advertised.  The special offers that are made are not worth anything.  You get an ""experimental browser"".  Not sure why I have to pay for something that is experimental.  It automatically down loads ""suggested"" books for you to read, then they are very difficult to get rid of, some I never could get rid of.  It has lots of cool sounding features that are of no use to an average reader, maybe in some special cases only.  I read the 53 page instruction book that came with it.  The operating system is not intuitive, not like windows or any other operating system.  You have to start from scratch to learn your way around it.  The screen is too small. I spent $200 on the device, a charge and power cord ( no, they do not come with it) and a supossedly leather cover.  Not sure what good it is without a charger, but you have to pay extra for that.  I would say total value of all items was less than $50 and I am being generous at that.  I kept it a few days past the 30 day return period because I was struggling trying to learn to make it work.

It's traveled the world with me and continues to be a staple in my pack, whether across the town or country. All the things I loved about my old one seemed to be improved with this one... size, battery life, display quality and durability. Reading on beaches or poolside always left me a little worried so the waterproof feature was also a huge selling point. As one of my couple key travel items I thought why not upgrade. But after two weeks I'm sending it back and hanging onto my older paperwhite. I don't write a lot of reviews but for those of you torn about upgrading here's my main two points for returning:1) Display quality. This is the main reason for the return. Having both paperwhites side by side I just can't get with the newer screen. I LOVE the offwhite almost sephia tone of kindles. Its the sole reason you can read for hours outside without strain. And while the new one isn't exactly an iPad, its definitely whiter and brighter. Plus the edges are now flush with the screen - giving them a glossy look. Sure it's sleeker but now you have so much more glare and smudges (which in turn reflect even more glare).2) Battery life. A lot of people mentioned it and its true, this one definitely dies faster. Granted we're still talking weeks of battery life (on airplane mode) but I'm not going to upgrade to a device that just doesn't last a long.I still give it a good rating because if you havent had a kindle before or don't have one to side by side compare you probably won't even notice those changes. The screen and battery are still great - just not as good as the last gen.

FIVE STARS!,5,Verified Purchase,Digital Storage Capacity: 8Offer Type: With Special OffersColor: BlackOption: Without Kindle Unlimited,"The reviews alone are what got me sold. I took the giant leap and bought myself my first ever e-reader. I used my saved up money and I’m a teenager so that’s a huge decision for me. I bought the 32gb, even though I know I could trade it in for new releases, but on the off chance that I didn’t like the new release, then I could just keep using this Kindle knowing that I won’t have to worry about the device’s storage limits. I can just keep on using this Kindle while waiting for a new release that I would like to trade in with. I did get the “with special offers” though they don’t seem disruptive. They only appear on the lock screen which you can just ignore and save some money and when in the future you get annoyed with it, I’ve read that you can just pay to get it removed. NO REGRETS whatsoever. For anyone looking to buy their first ever e-reader or looking for an upgrade, look no further because the All New Kindle Paperwhite 2018 is for you! Buy it! You will not regret it! I AM SO IN LOVE WITH IT! And you will be too!(First picture: lowest brightness setting. Looking pretty clear)(Second picture: highest brightness setting. Still looking pretty clear)(Third picture: inverted screen with no brightness. Looking good.)The case: Amazon water-safe fabric cover in BlueUPDATE: It’s been more than a week, approx. 8 days, since I first bought the Kindle Paperwhite 2018. I HAVE NOT yet charged this and it is still just on 40% after more than a week! With the Wi-Fi on the whole time and with the brightness being changed up and down. When reading before or in bed, I turn the brightness all the way down and invert it to the black screen and white text and it looks clear for me without the harsh light disrupting my circadian rhythm. That’s a win for me. I usually end up having to charge my other devices after just 2 days of full use but this one is a winner for me!So glad I bought this one instead of the Oasis, which is a lot more expensive. This does everything the Oasis does plus it fits right into your bag and it’s super lightweight. The Paperwhite has a page orientation of landscape and portrait view which all anybody really needs. I’ve heard that the Oasis has a sensor page orientation that rotates the screen and no rotation lock which is a plus point towards the Paperwhite.GO BUY THE ALL NEW KINDLE PAPERWHITE WATERPROOF 2018!

This is especially troublesome when you want to fine tune the zoom. So, it will always ALWAYS zoom between too much and not enough !!! You can never zoom it just right, this is extremely annoying (well, it is not entirely the lagginess to blame, it also has to do with the fact that the zoom comes about in steps rather than in a continuous manner) !!  Second, it can't reflush/realign the text to fit the screen, and it is the BIGGEST DOWNSIDE of this device ! ! ! !  So, when the font is too small and the paragraph width is too wide, after you zoom in, you'll have to keep swiping left and right repeatedly in order to read each single sentence.

I was drawn to the Oasis because it cost more so must obviously be better but after going to Best Buy to see how they “felt”, I found that the Oasis just didn’t feel right.

Early on it developed a bright pinhole in the lower right corner of the screen.  Not a big deal once I got used to it.  Then, recently, it developed about a 3/8""  tear and bright line in the screen where the last line of text appears.  It was my second e-ink kindle to fail but 5 1/2 years was a tolerable lifespan for modern  electronics and with the screen tear it had to go.Enter the latest Kindle Paperwhite without a raised bezel.  It is too small and is somewhat uncomfortable to hold.  Between the slightly smaller size and lack of the raised bezel my left thumb is constantly drifting onto the screen and flipping the pages back (I'm left-handed).  I find myself constantly having to flip through multiple pages, back and forth, to get back to where I was reading.  IRRITATING.  Holding it by the back without using my thumbs hold the front frame is difficult and often painful (I have some arthritis in my hands).  I see no value in the current bezel-less design trend.

I would have given my first Paperwhite five stars, no question. The only reason I considered a trade-in/upgrade was that I had used my original Paperwhite heavily for over four years and didn't want it to go out on me unexpectedly, since I do use it frequently. No signs of it failing, but . . . .I also have to give full credit for a smooth process in the trade-in process. I received a 25% credit off the sale price toward the purchase of a new Kindle and gift card credit for the trade-in (contingent on the trade-in being shipped and in the reported condition) at the time I ordered the new Paperwhite and thus was able to receive my new Paperwhite before sending off the old one so that I didn't have to go a day without my Kindle. I received a pre-paid label to ship my first Paperwhite in at no expense to me. The trade-in was processed quickly and fairly.  Great service there.So, why the three stars?  Well, my new Paperwhite is still a nice product, but it is actually inferior to my original in several ways and thus is a complete failure as an upgrade.  It presumably is waterproof, which would be nice if I ever spilled a glass of water around it or some such thing. However, it seems to have a shorter battery life rather than the longer one I'd been led to believe it would.  I used to have to charge the old one about every three weeks; this one goes through 10-12% battery charge per day.  The old one took maybe a second to wake up; this one can take up to five seconds. The old one would ""wake up"" at the light intensity I had set for reading (fairly low, so that I can read at night if I wake up and can't get back to sleep, without waking my spouse); this one comes on BRIGHT--to the point of waking my spouse from sleep, which had never happened with the old one and which limits my middle-of-the-night reading.

My 13 year old son also uses Kindle and I have to say that he reads a lot more because he has it (he has the previous generation which I also love).

Teach Philly,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGUVHM7PZP6QBQUKQBUZ3LNYKEZQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,Why so bright paperwhite?,2,Verified Purchase,Digital Storage Capacity: 8Offer Type: With Special OffersColor: BlackOption: Without Kindle Unlimited,"I've owned a few kindles in my time and this is by far my worst ""upgrade"" The only thing this paperwhite has going for it is that it is waterproof. However I don't even fit in my bathtub and underwater reading isn't a hobby of mine. So the waterproofing is just a gimmick really.The thing that kills this kindle for me is that it is so damn bright! My previous non waterproof kindle paperwhite version could get much dimmer such that I didn't feel like I was staring at a bright rectangle when I was reading in bed.Pros:- Its a kindle. Any e-reader is better than lugging around a paper version of any George RR Martin novel.- The totally flat front face is pretty nice- It is super light- higher screen resolution is cool tooCons:- It is SO BRIGHT. When ever would you need it on the brightest setting. And the lowest setting isn't even feasible when trying to read in bed in a dark room.- The bottom power button juts out and is very easy to press. I commonly hold the bottom of my devices with my pinky and I've accidentally turned this damn thing off more than a couple of times.- Turning it on takes quite a bit longer than my previous kindle paperwhite.- Turning it on flashes the screen to full brightness. So if you wake up in the middle of the night and decide to read a chapter of your book you better put on your sunglasses first.- The home screen interface is getting so much more annoying. Amazon stop trying to sell me more stuff. We all know you're going to take over the world soon anyway, and the paltry money you make from my book purchases is not going to make that much of a difference.Additional notes:- Don't tell me I should read with my bed light on anyway. I know about your blue-light hatred, and I agree, but I'm not switching over my library to that yellow nook rectangle.- Don't tell me I should invert the colors of my kindle to make it less bright. That's just dumb. I did it and I hate it.- Who the hell needs 8 gb of memory for books?- The only reason I had to get this latest generation is that I'm an idiot and lost my old one on a plane.- If the waterproofing feature changed your life for the better. Please let me know, I'm curious about the conditions you read under.",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/RO9CUR2GZIF5A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"March 20, 2019",

The speed and screen clarity have been greatly improved and far surpassed my expectations. Reading in the dark is gentle on my eyes and doesn't cause severe eye strain as looking at a monitoring for a similar amount of time might. The Kindle Paperwhite is extremely light, and I can hold it in one hand for many hours without much effort, which is great for voracious readers that can't seem to put books down, like myself.The one issue that I've noticed is that the screen and backing are magnets for fingerprints, and you find fingerprints EVERYWHERE after only using it for a day or so. Be prepared to clean it daily so the fingerprints don't interfere with the screen text. I only wish that I had known how good the Paperwhite Kindle series was while I was in college, as this would have saved me a ton of money and stress of waiting for a book to come in the mail while professors assigned reading assignments within the first week of the quarter. If you're looking for a gift for a college-bound student, avid reader or even if you yourself want to get back into reading I would 100% recommend this item as it has reinvigorated my love of reading and it's discreteness provided by its small black design allows you to take it places where it might be otherwise inappropriate or inconvenient to have a large paperback book.I have yet to test out the waterproof feature, as having any personal hand-held technology near water gives me instant anxiety. I'll have to test it once I overcome my innate instinct to protect my devices from water.Tracking my battery life, with 10 hours of use I’ve used about 10% battery life, give or take a bit. Although it’s important to note I’ve stuck to reading exclusively (no audiobook), use little or no backlight during the day and turn airplane mode on when I’m not downloading books. Obviously, the battery usage will vary depending on usage, but I am satisfied with the current battery drain.Overall, I give the Kindle Paperwhite a 5/5, other than the fingerprint issues and the capitalistic ethicality of selling a product at a discounted price that comes loaded with ads (I digress). I am very pleased with my purchase and will most likely be using this as a go-to gift for friends and family that are avid readers.",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/RVKQMZDTZ6D1Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"April 10, 2019",

I have high standards for technology and was really excited reading about the newest kindle, the specs, and all the glowing positive reviews. I bought this kindle as a Christmas gift to myself and was let down by the quality. The whole thing felt a bit cheap and the screen refresh made the device unusable in my opinion. Every time I scrolled or flipped the page the whole screen would flash and pixels would refresh at different rates. To add insult to injury the cord that came with the device wouldn't plug in to the kindle; I tried another microUSB and had no issues. Due to these factors I decided the kindle wasn't going to be something that I would use. So I started the return process. I shipped the kindle back on 12/27/18 and I understand that because of New Years the package delivery was delayed. I checked the tracking number for the return and it arrived on 1/4/19.

My suspicion is that the added bluetooth functionality is slowing down the device remarkably, to the point that the touch screen feels defective.  I might believe that we just received a bad device, except both of the Paperwhite we bought for our sons have the same issue.

The Kindle Paperwhite may be changing my mind on e-readers. The lighting is much much kinder to the eyes, I just finished a “test” novel that I read in a few days, often sitting for a few hours with the Kindle. It is also significantly lighter than my iPad mini and it’s pocket sized which will make traveling with it much easier than other tablet devices. It is of course strictly an e-reader, not a tablet, so no movies or other games/apps but even so I may end up leaving my iPad behind all together in the future.

So my huge library of e-books I got elsewhere are useless. I STILL have to use two separate devices to listen to audible while reading or spend even more money buying books through amazon that I already have! Basically their audible function works like youtube. You can't minimize the app then open your book because it immediately stops playing audible.Horribly disappointed about this.

The flat screen is wonderful and gets rid of the issue I had with dirt getting between the screen and casing with my old one.However, there are some downsides which are shameful in this day and age. First of all, it's still Micro USB rather than USB-C, which seems bizarrely archaic given its release date and the ease of the new standard. This means, when travelling, I have to bring another cord specifically for it. Secondly, I don't buy my books through Amazon, and for some reason Amazon refuses to remember Collections for books that are transferred to the device via USB. For some reason, if you use their email system (which is terribly slow, especially when dealing with large numbers of books) they'll let you keep your Collections, but otherwise they don't track them AND they notify you that they're not tracking them whenever you mess with them. The least they could do is make Collections editable by third-party programs, or include a method of organizing books via the computer. The ability to look-up 3rd party ebooks on Goodreads would be great.My last complaint (and this is relatively minor) is that when waking up, the device turns on its back-light very brightly before adjusting down to my personal settings (which I keep rather low).

Some reviews mention not needing  waterproof component, but I read in the bath and the extra peace of mind is great.The one gripe I have is with the software, not the product- (as others have mentioned) the screen wakes at full brightness and then adjusts to your previous setting. This is fine 90% of the time, but if you turn the kindle on in a dark room, it’s blinding for a few seconds. Hopefully this will be fixed in a software update.If you’re strapped for cash and have a previous version of the Paperwhite, you don’t have to upgrade since it’s not a totally revamped device.

Firstly, there are loads of books that simply don't exist for Kindle. The idea of a Kindle is to simplify, not to add yet another tool/device to update and cart around. Secondly, some of the 'Kindle' books for download are 'not compatible' with this newest, most up-to-date Kindle Paperwhite. Again, unfortunate. I don't want to read off of a phone, that's why I bought a Kindle.... Thirdly, .docs and such work fine on the Kindle APP but don't show up (or sometimes do randomly?) on the Kindle itself. I hate the 'sync' button. It's your only agency when something doesn't work, and when that happens, It. Doesn't. Sync. Again...annoying. This technology isn't new – I feel that there should be more homogeneity/support within these products so that the user isn't constantly made to bear the load for compatibility.

A mistake.  First, new paperwhite came with the wrong cable.  Called Amazon, authorized a free purchase of the correct cable.  Ten days to deliver what should have been shipped overnight, since it is Amazon's error.The issue that really makes me sorry that I upgraded is how the paperwhite handles books I load from my computer, rather that the Amazon store.  With the old kindle, the list on the home screen was collections, followed by books not in a collection.  That made it very easy to see newly added books and to place them in a collection if so desired, or if they didn't fit any collection just leave them in a list following the collections.  With the new paperwhite, if you show collections, you don't see any items not in a collection.  So, if you want to see something outside of a collection, you have to scroll through everything you have on your paperwhite.

Also of interest, if you buy the cover for this model and the Kindle is shut off, but then open the case cover-the Kindle turns on.Certainly none are deal breakers but just an FYI.Otherwise, I love the Paperwhite!",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/RUEC3Y0WFG46H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"March 13, 2019",

It was just easy and a big improvement over my Kindle keyboard.  I used it every day for almost 6 years, and would have kept it forever, if it hadn't started freezing up on me too often.  I loved how all my books went onto the device, then when I deleted them, they went into the cloud.  Someday I would have deleted them from Amazon - but I didn't.  So here was my problem.  When I bought the new paperwhite, I had it registered to my account.  Amazon put over 4000 books (many were free books and this was 8 years worth) onto my new Kindle, and didn't differentiate the books I read from the books I didn't.  I had to go 20 pages in to find the book I was reading, and then download it to the device.  It started over on page one. Calling Amazon and talking to a representative and a supervisor wasn't going to change this.  They apologized and took a note to improve on this.  Now I could have deregistered and started over, but there were some good books that I really wanted to keep.  So now I have to go through all of those books to see which ones to delete on line and which ones to keep.  Even if I deregistered, I would still have to do this.  So far it's taken me 4 hours to delete 2 years worth of books.  And now the next problem will be, even after all that work,  there will be no record on Amazon of books I read, so I could end up getting books that I already read.  Very frustrating!Don't get me started on the battery that should last weeks.  Mine lasts 3 days on airplane mode, so that's about the same as my older Kindles.  Now reading this Kindle is the same experience, only the color of the light is different.My biggest mistake was paying more for extra memory and 3G.  That is all on me.

Unless you’re wanting to read top sellers be prepared to sift through a lot of smaller shorter novels by amateur writers. If that is your niche though have at it but for $9.99/month you’re better off seeing what your local library offers first.,B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/R2CXA4CC72J9NN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"January 17, 2019",

I love the ease in which you can borrow library books on kindle. However, the battery life on the kobo is much better. I find that I can go months before the kobo is down to 50%. On the other hand kindle reaches 50% every few days. Also, kobo gives reading stats, which kindle does not. (If there is the same feature on kindle, pls let me know where it is.) Kobo does not have “special offers”, which can be a distraction, and personally I don’t want to pay to have them removed.  The dictionary on kindle is much better. Unlike kobo, I can listen to audio books, which is a great advantage. All the other features are comparable.

I started with one of the original versions and finally ""upgraded"" to a Paperwhite in 2012 that I still have and love (it has a B01B serial number) and it has no offers.Jun 2018, I bought what I think is the 7th or 8th gen Paperwhite with offers (I’ll assume 8th gen for the rest of this review) . I didn’t like the ads on the 8th gen and I thought the “new interface on the front page” was annoying.  Kindle had a trade-in deal, so I sent the 8th gen back when I bought the 10th gen. I got money back (not much) for the 8th gen, and I got 25% off the 10th gen.I bought the new Paperwhite, 10th gen, no offers, upgraded to 32G storage.IS THE 10TH GEN PAPERWHITE WORTH GIVING UP AND OLDER MODEL AND PAYING MORE $$? -The new case is not as good as the old cases.  -I think Amazon cheaped out. They just don’t have as good a “feel.” They're more flimsy too.  -Sidebar: the “cobalt purple” case is actually cobalt blue. Not purple at all. -10th gen doesn’t “wake up” just by opening the case (which is annoying). You have to swipe the screen.  -The “waking up” period is also quite long  -The backlight comes up initially on “full bright” before reverting to your normal backlight. This is annoying when you try to read in bed at night, and will ruin your night vision. -I don’t see the 167ppi to 300 ppi resolution difference -I don’t care for the new font. I think it’s harder to read than previous generations. -The refresh rate is surprisingly just as slow as older Paperwhites. No ""upgrade"" here. -The screen is sometimes unresponsive. It just “freezes.""  -I like actually being able to feel the ""edge"" of the screen just for holding the Paperwhite. 10th gen screen has less of an edge so it just feels a bit odd to hold it. Not a big deal, but it is a tactile thing. -10th gen has “cellular connectivity,” but it’s a joke. Every time I’ve tried to download a book on cellular, my Paperwhite says I need to ""be on wifi to download this book as it is too large"". Super. -Amazon advertises “weeks” for battery life. I read every day. It hasn’t lasted even a week on one charge for me. My 2012 version battery lasts longer, as did the 8th gen I sent back. -Power button is on the bottom, so if you prop it up (for instance at the gym) to read, it sometimes “goes dark""/""shuts off"" -I did get larger storage capacity, but it seemed to slow down when I downloaded more content and/or collections to the device  -The new USB cable shipped with the device didn't fit in the Paperwhite. Looking at reviews, this seems common to the 10th gen. My old cable, however, worked with the 10th gen fine.  BIGGEST ""PLUSES/REASONS TO BUY"" THE 10TH GEN: -Seems to work better with the libraries for transferring books -10th gen is waterproof  (but I've never needed this feature and doubt I will) -If you like having a lot of content on the Kindle at one time, the 10th gen you CAN get much more capacity, BUT  -8G storage on the 8th gen was plenty big for me  -and the 10th gen slowed down considerably when I downloaded more content and/or collections  -Amazon tech support was no help in fixing this issue. I just had to remove the content I added. -I have loaded some large PDFs to the Paperwhites, and the 10th gen doesn’t freeze or crash opening them, and earlier versions did.I’m having ""buyer’s remorse"" sending my 8th gen back for the 10th gen. I paid a lot more $ for the 10th gen and did not get much more Kindle. Perhaps Amazon rushed to get the 10th gen out for Christmas 2018, but I don't think it's 'ready for prime time,' and it's not a great upgrade.Honestly, I like my 2012 Paperwhite (serial # starting B01B) more than the 8th gen and 10th gen. I like the case, font, screen, and the battery lasts WAY longer then 8 & 10th gen; but, full disclosure, it doesn't work as well with library check outs/returns. It works, just not as well as 10th gen.When Amazon shipped the 10th gen Paperwhite, it comes with minimal packing. Amazon cleverly shipped it in a box with a 25 pound item on top of it. The Paperwhite was undamaged, so the packing must be fine, but it seemed a poor shipping choice by Amazon to combine the 2 orders.",B07CXG6C9W,/gp/customer-reviews/RIURB0WP9SYHD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CXG6C9W,"November 25, 2018",17
