Kindle Customer,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AENQUDO6XVMLPVW4OGBDVSJ2D67A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,"Good, even great case. Just got a few quirks...",4,Verified Purchase,,"I chose to buy the custom image option for the Fire HDX 8.9 because Amazon does not currently carry that size case in a color I was interested in. So far I have found that the case itself is very well made and seemes to be sturdy with the potential to be nice and long lasting. The magnets are strong and the origami cover/stand is easy to get used to and use. So all good there.Now to discuss the custom image: I am afraid that I have to deduct a star for the image. Let it be known that the vibrant, colorful, and sharp images displayed to entice you to purchase this item are very little like what is printed on the case. The colors are muted and all edges between them are blurred slightly. I realize that some disparity between advertised images and actual product is to be expected, but I had not expected the discrepancy to be so large. The image I had chosen was both detailed and dark and I'm afraid much of the detail has been lost into the surrounding darkness. Not to say that the picture is unattractive, I still like it and think it's pretty, but losing some of those details is rather disappointing. Hence the deducted star.Should you wish to have a custom case made, my advice would be to choose a very bright, sharp image with the understanding that some of that will be lost or else choose something modern-art-ish that won't matter if some of the colors and details blur together.All in all, I like my new case and would probably buy another one should I need to.",B00FJEDOWI,/gp/customer-reviews/R39LBZ43V6HXRI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FJEDOWI,"January 11, 2014",8
Lydia J.,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFSQXEU7MNZHLUEATNANFRDNOEMQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,"It's ok, but could be a bit better",3,Verified Purchase,,"My custom case arrived today on time. The idea is great and seems straight forward, but there are a few quirks that I'm sure will be improved upon in time. First, you can't put a back and front image on the case, only one side or the other. When designing the case, the preview doesn't match the thumbnail of the final image, so pay attention to the final thumbnail when you're actually placing your image to make sure that parts and pieces don't get cut off inappropriately by the fold gutters if putting your image on the front.I got this as a gift for someone because I couldn't find a Kindle case in the color they would've wanted, let alone one that is more resistant to drops and spills and is still decorative. They will probably be happy very happy with it, however, I submitted a print quality, high resolution image and it still looks pretty washed out compared to what I saw on my monitor in Photoshop. That's the main reason I am giving this product 3 stars, but I would actually give it 3.5. But considering the cost, you can't keep making tweaks to over exaggerate the color to work around that possible production issue. Mine is not the only comment like this, so it must be their application process that washes out the image. The image was put onto the case in a way that it is apart of the case and looks like it will wear well and not peel off under average circumstances. In terms of the case itself, the magnetics are strong, but I wish that the well to hold the Kindle was a bit more secure. This case is very thin and lightweight and really is just more of a decorative cover, stronger than a cloth or fake leather sleeve; so I would still be careful about how you handle you Kindle and avoid dropping it.",B00FJEDOWI,/gp/customer-reviews/R1M5GHBDB3N1WE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FJEDOWI,"February 21, 2014",2
Russell David Phillips,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGF5CYSOOQXS55DOCV7XOS2DR4XQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,And the ability to customize the cover is awesome. Because of the origami folding thing you will ...,3,Verified Purchase,,"PROS: This is a decent case, the image printing worked as advertised, etc...  And the ability to customize the cover is awesome.  Because of the origami folding thing you will have black bands across the image so plan your image accordingly.NEUTRAL:Origami Stand: The whole origami folding cover thing to provide a stand is interesting but there are pros and cons and in the end it's a bit of a wash.  It is more interesting looking but since the cover folds in a couple of ways when you open from a corner like half the cover will open and there can be a little fumbling to flip the cover over. VERY minor really but there are other cases with stands that work as well so It's not like it seems to add anything.  That plus the bands across cover criss cross your image limits your image choices.  And finally like every other stand out there its always at an angle that is best viewed with it on your desk and you sit in a chair looking at it.  I really want one which could be nearly upright but no luck.  Again this is all neutral in the end.CONS:Bit Heavy: For my taste the case is a bit clunky.  There is a significant difference between the bare tablet and the tablet in the case.Magnetic Hold: The tablet is held in place by magnets which are strong enough so it stays in place firmly but at the same time I like the  that it doesn't slip out but it can shift very slightly dependent on how you are holding it. When you open the case the cover magnetically attaches to the back to.  It's pretty slick but there is some slight wiggle in the case I believe.  When I watch Netflix in bed at night I occasionally experience the volume suddenly going to zero.  I believe (but I'm not sure) this is the reason why.  Also because of the magnetic cover attaching to the back the ONLY way you can stand the tablet is in the proscribed manner.  Like I said I prefer a more upright angle but the magnetic attach makes it's not possible even if you don't mind a precarious balance.OVERALL: A solid case, it will protect your kindle and you can customize it.  Most of my issues with it are of a personal taste nature so if the items I have a problem with are something you don't care about then you should consider this a higher rating for you.",B00FJEDOWI,/gp/customer-reviews/RMKELFPV3FAUO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FJEDOWI,"August 28, 2014",

After looking at my options, I decided to order this case.  I picked the stock photo of birch trees with red leaves on a black case.  I must admit I was a little disappointed at how muted the picture was compared to the picture I selected.  But it is still interesting to look at and while the photo option was fun, it was not the main reason for buying the case.  This is a wonderful case that opens easily and closes securely.

It is a very heavy case also which defeats the purpose of the lighter tablet.  The case looks almost too big for the Kindle HDX 8.9 and does not hold it all.

As others have mentioned, there is a slight tacky feel to the printing, but this wears off after a couple of days.  The printing seems very durable and I love the green floral pattern I chose.

NF,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGGRSVDIIIJY3IUIMC4X5IYA2GRA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,Clever origami case but image quality not quite what's shown in preview **Updated**,3,,,"This is basically the Amazon Kindle Fire Origami Case, but with an image added to it by Cafe Press. The process for selecting the image and creating your perfect cover is fairly painless:Step 1: Decide whether you want the image on the front, back, or both. If you select both front & back, it has to be the same image for both; you can't put a different image on each.Step 2: Select your image. Amazon has 9 ""Exclusives"" images, all of them various patterns, plus 30 other pattern images and 30 nature scenes. You can also browse your computer for an image you have taken or created.The one drawback to the latter is that it has to be a pretty large image. If, like me, all of your personal images have been resized for, e.g., display on Facebook, you'll find that they are too small for this process. The dialog notes, ""We recommend using an image greater than 1 MB, and for best results a 2500 X 3500px or higher resolution photo shot in portrait mode."" I tried it with an image that was 513 pixels high by 408 pixels wide and it was ridiculously small in the preview mode, even at maximum magnification, covering only a postage-stamp area of the case. There are options to zoom, move, and rotate your personal image but there is a limit to how much you can zoom and there is no option to tile an image.The dialog that walks you through the process has a good preview that shows you what the image will look like on the case and I had fun playing around with various options. Ultimately, I opted for a nature scene, autumn trees reflected in a pond. The image in the preview was sharp and clear, with vibrant colors; the image on the case I received in the mail less so. The colors were muted and the image not as sharp. It was still attractive but you should definitely be aware that what you see is not exactly what you will get.Step 3: Add to Cart.That's basically it. Because the image has to be attached to the case, this case won't be available in two days, even if you have Amazon Prime. In my case, it took a little over a week.As for the case itself, it's the standard Amazon Polyurethane Origami Case. The origami notion was a clever idea and it's fun to play with but I'm not totally sold on it. The case is a bit heavier than I expected, since it has a magnet to keep the case closed, magnets to lock in the origami mode when the case is open and you're using it as a stand, and magnets to hold the underside of the tablet to the case. It made me a little nervous that the tablet didn't lock into the case, as is typical of most cases but, so far, the magnets are holding the case securely in place and I've not seen any sign of slippage or any chance that it will fall out of the case.Naturally, the case supports automatically turning the tablet on when you open the case and off when you close it. Some users have reported problems with the cover folded all the way back that the tablet gets fooled by the magnets and it thinks the case is closed so it shuts down. Personally, I haven't seen this.In origami mode, the case can prop up the tablet either in landscape mode or in portrait mode. The one thing missing is that with the older generation cases, you could prop the tablet up at various angles. With the origami case, there's only one angle, although that angle appears to have been reasonably well-chosen.Overall, I give the case 3 stars. I'm taking away a star because the image quality isn't what the preview showed and because they require such a large image for personal pictures, and another star because the origami case has some quirks that take getting used to. On balance, I think I have a slight preference for the simplicity of the previous-generation cases.Update: Amazon customer 22twain, in a reply to my review of the 7"" case, had a couple of great comments that I think are worth repeating. Quoting his comments:I don't do the Facebooks thing, but there is something to be said about non-destructive photo editing. As a general rule, before editing any of my personal photos, I make a copy of the originals at the native resolution and save off elsewhere in order to prevent accidental modification.Regarding the muted colors and image clarity, that's the difference between looking at an image on-screen (RGB) and the printed equivalent based on a pigment (CMYK) process. If you choose to use your own image(s), bump up the contrast, brightness and/or saturation in a photo editing program first. I use Adobe Photoshop to ""tweak"" my colors before sending to print, but pre-installed software on your PC/MAC can tackle the basics.",B00FJEDOWI,/gp/customer-reviews/RRU4HVMMWV7B9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FJEDOWI,"December 23, 2013",33
