Crawford,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFFQASQ4UVSHU6WLVEUCDRZRT7YQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,You won't know why until you have one,5,Verified Purchase,Size: 38mmStyle: Silver Aluminum with White Sport Band,"Why do people love their Apple Watches? It's just a watch, for pete's sake! But if you have one you know right away. There's a small miracle that happens in a busy life when you can answer your phone (er, watch?) with your hands full. Or just glancing down to see the text message you just got. Or even completing those freaking rings (don't know? of you will). There's very little bad I can say after having my Series 2 for the last couple of years. I'm happy to get the 3 to have the always-on feature of cellular. I can leave the house and it's not even a problem if I left my phone. Or go for a walk without having a heavy phone in my pocket. It's not even about style, there's just a huge practicality of having a small device attached to your wrist that makes so many problems go away. Here are the positives:• Excellent watch. Like, as a watch.• Receive calls. Make calls.• Receive text messages. Facebook, Twitter, IG, and more.• Interchangeable bands. Fit the look you want, change on a dime.• Siri• Alarms, notes and all the other little apps.• Fitness trackingReally, I don't have any cons. I know people think a smart phone in your back pocket is the top, but this just changes the game. I don't know a single person who ever got an Apple Watch and didn't like it. And the funny thing is you'll never know unless you get one - Because how it changes what you do is the thing that makes it amazing. It's all those small little ways that make for a stupidly brilliant product.Seriously, you, your wife, your boyfriend - It make a perfect gift.",B07K39FRSL,/gp/customer-reviews/R8AZOIBRBRZ2U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07K39FRSL,"November 25, 2018",599

Benjamin,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFBYV5DCGLHOIRYH25ZC2MEEHOKA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,Great upgrade from Series 1,5,Verified Purchase,Size: 42mmStyle: Space Gray Aluminum with Black Sport Band,"Upgraded from a Series 1 to this Series 3.  I can't believe the difference in speed!  That alone made the upgrade absolutely worth it!  The move between apps and the messages app are smooth and succinct.  The added features that my old watch did not have are intuitive and time-saving: the raise to talk Siri is perfect and works flawlessly.  Not having to ""call out"" to Siri is great.  The walkie-talkie feature is a tad clumsy, but works well for a quick check-in to/from my wife while I am at work.  The kids have enjoyed it too when they miss me during the longer days.  While I have not swam with the watch, I have worn it in the shower a handful of times.  The water eject button is quite intelligent.  I think it simply uses sounds waves to push the water out of the speaker port.  You can hear a ""wshhh"" sound, hearing its effectiveness.  I will say though, the pitch/volume of the eject noise is quite loud...people WILL look!Like many others, I was hesitating between the new Series 4 and this Series 3.

I really thought I could use Siri like I use it on my phone, which was a big selling point for me. 8/10 times I use Siri it tells me to continue on my phone. I asked Siri to take me to 'such and such' and it gave me directions with a vibration to the wrist with turns (really close to turning, should give a bit more time to get in the lane lol) which I like. It's good for having your texts at your wrist and that's about it for me. I tried to answer a call on it while my phone was in the other room but the quality was so bad they hung up. It won't set an alarm, only a timer. No Google/internet searching whatsoever (hince no Siri). No scrolling through your social media like FB or Reddit but gives notifications which is annoying. It's kinda like heyyyy pick up your cell and look at this. The battery is good, I haven't charged it in almost 3 days. It tells me to stand up if I'm sitting for an hour. I can ping me cell when I misplace it. That's about all i have used it for.

After weighing the differences between the Series 3 and Series 4, I decided that this was not only cost effective but completely comparable to the Series 4. The newest model only has marginal differences such as an ECG meter and a slightly brighter screen, but in the era of negligible upgrades there really is no reason not to consider this model over the newer ones. Unless the Series 4 drops in price or even newer, future models has features like a selfie camera, why pay the price?

It was too good to pass up.  I can't see much of a change in functionality from the Series 2, so no learning curve is required.  After three years, the battery on my series 2 was approaching the end of it's life which required a recharge during the day to make it past 5:00pm.

This watch does everything, even the things I didn't know I needed before.  The main feature I wished was better is battery life.  You only get about 18 hours out of a new, fully charged Apple Watch, so it needs to go on the charger every night.My biggest recommendation is to also purchase a screen protector.

I was a garmin forerunner holdout for years and finally switched as I wanted a watch to listen to music with while running. The only negative thing I can say about this watch is battery life but I knew that before purchasing it. My solution was using the watch in nightstand mode at night and it’s always charged for a full day of activity.  Please note by doing this u can’t use the watch to track sleep but that’s not an issue as i have never had a need to track sleep. I get about 3.5 miles of running in a day and with GPS, heart rate and music playback on and I still have not dipped below 30 percent battery life by the time i take it off to charge at night. The only thing I miss about the garmin ecosystem is the ability to track mileage on my gear/shoes.The reason I am writing a review is to urge u to by Apple Care +. It’s 2.49 a month or 49 dollars for two years of coverage and no I am not associated with Apple. I am just a crazy active person getting about 20k steps a day.I was wearing the watch yesterday while edging the fence line with my gas trimmer. I rolled my ankle on a slope and fell into the fence. The angle must have been just right and hit the upper left corner of the watch off the fence post shattering the screen.I was shocked to find that the cost of the screen replacement on the watch is the exact price I bought it for from amazon. It’s 229. With Apple Care + the cost comes down to 69 dollars. With the care plan u are covered for two years from date of purchase and they allow for two accidental damage repairs over the life of the policy. The only catch is u have to add the plan within 60 days of purchase.That’s all I have to say. I used to say AirPods were the most innovative thing Apple has done in ages but now I feel it’s the watch. Apple pay even more amazing on the watch and being able to voice respond to Tex’s is killer since Apple keeps iMessages locked down to their devices only for the time being.",B07K39FRSL,/gp/customer-reviews/R21D77AYWQOS8N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07K39FRSL,"April 28, 2019",4

I am able to check and respond to texts, Messenger messages, and emails, and there are multiple features which allow you to silence the phone or put it on Do Not Disturb (just like the iPhone). Most of all, however, I love that the watch tracks my activity. I am not a fitness buff and I did not really have an interest in tracking my heart rate and steps throughout the day, however, it is fun to look at the statistics and set goals. I also like the, ""Breathe,"" feature which coaches you through a minute of breathing--it helps you cool down and forces you to take a short break from life.Long story short: I thought I would regret purchasing this and that it would be a waste of money, but I am extremely happy that I did. I utilize it more than I thought I would and I love all of the features on it.",B07K39FRSL,/gp/customer-reviews/R33CDKWQS4I6OH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07K39FRSL,"March 27, 2019",4

I just went to the Apple store to get it repaired and I was told that it would cost $229 plus tax to get it repaired or replaced. For that price, I will throw it out .

Amazon Customer,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEAZUYBDHYQGMHVZPVBV7YQWL7FQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,If you are active in any way at all this is not the product for you,1,,Size: 38mmStyle: Silver Aluminum with White Sport Band,"Had the watch for 4 months paid for with hard earned money.Read all of the reviews and the ads from Apple made it sound like it was pretty durable. I actually did a lot of research on this before buying asking random people that had the watch if they liked it and inquired about it.Seriously asking random strangers for input. Asking if they felt it was durable and wouldn't break easily.They all told me yes it was a good product and worth the investment.  Flash forward 4 months later, 4months, removing the watch at night to put on the charger like I have done for the past 4 months. It slipped out of my hand and fell. It fell not even 3 feet and hit the floor.  I glanced at it briefly and it seemed fine.  Go to put it on in the morning and I notice a hair line crack. Upon closer inspection I see that the whole screen is cracked and a chip exists in the lower corner. Oh crap, We have the insurance with the service provider hopefully it is covered. No chance, the insurance for devices is a poor investment for the record.  Ok, maybe I can take it to Apple and see if they can fix it and explore my options couldn't be too much they will stand up behind their product. If I explain, after all they advertise that is for an active lifestyle, clearly a 3 foot drop should not have caused damage like this.  Wrong, basically if you are active in any way this watch will break and Apple will not step up on this.They informed me that I could buy a new watch for $400 and send this one in for repair. After the watch is repaired then I could return it for full refund.  Hmm interesting, as if I have $400 laying around for something like this, it was suggested that I ""float"" the cost somehow.  So then I ask, How much will the repair be? They said $268, after the visit i was informed on 1-800-MYA-PPLE. The repair is $289.  A repair to a $400 watch which I have had for 4 months that broke from a 3 foot fall to the floor. Spend $289 to fix it and ""float"" $400 for a temporary replacement.  Apple, you have just created a very very upset person that will continue to tell this story to all people through all forms of media.  Your corporation has forgotten the value of a hard earned dollar and what it means to stand behind a product that you produce and sell.  Lost the care for the working people that have made you so rich.Shame on you , Shame on you for this  Contact me at Gonetopozo@charter.net if you would like to hear my story and how Apple has forgotten the people that have filled their pockets.

When looking at the other sport fitness watches, I took in consideration, the price and quality of the watch. Then asked myself, what I would use the watch for and how much I would use it. The main consideration on why I wanted a fitness watch was to track my fitness. I have always enjoyed being active. I believe even if you aren’t active, they are still very beneficial for all kinds of people.Fitness Components of the Apple WatchThe watch, fitness wise, is able to track your calories, steps, heart beat and how many times you stand up in a day. It allows you to set your own fitness goals and customize them based around you. This setting holds you accountable. You receive daily notifications, every morning you put your watch on telling you how many rings you closed throughout the day, you also receive a weekly and monthly notification telling you how miles you walked and calories you burned.Another setting that is super cool is, the watch is water proof. If you are a swimmer or enjoy swimming it will allow you to swim with your watch on and tracks everything for you. I thought this setting was really so cool. I have tried it multiple times in the water and every time after I am done, my watch works just the same afterwards. The watch also allows you to download different fitness apps, making it capable to do all different kinds of workouts.Other Components of the Apple WatchThe watch does a lot more than just track your fitness. You are able to connect your phone to your watch through Bluetooth, making it so you don’t have to have your phone right on you. Your phone can be in the other room and you are still able to make/accept phone calls allowing you talk to the person from your watch, send/receive text messages, set alarms, events, check various social medias, download basically any app on your watch and its very customizable. You are able to switch out the bands to whatever color and style you want, change the wallpaper and look of your screen and set a lock on your watch. You can really make your watch, your watch.If you are thinking about what fitness watch to buy, I would highly recommend the apple watches. You are capable of doing so much and making the watch your own.",B07K39FRSL,/gp/customer-reviews/R32EBMVQM3V6N2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07K39FRSL,"February 7, 2019",2

Upon careful consideration, I chose to purchase a Series 3, 32 mm, space grey smartwatch from Apple. The sleek design allows for a comfortable fit on your wrist. The Apple Watch includes many features that allow you to track your health, meet your fitness goals, and remain hands-free. With the stand, move, and exercise rings feature you are able to track your workout, how many calories you’re burning, the number of minutes of you’ve completed, and how long you’ve been idle. Your heart rate can also be detected and the watch will let you know if your heart rate has dropped too low or has reached and unusually high rate. The water resistant feature helps to protect the watch from water or sweat damage.A few other pros to this watch are as follows:• Make and receive calls and text messages• Receive notifications from other apps such as Gmail, Facebook, Twitter, etc.• Interchangeable bands by size and color• Hands-free Siri• Alarms, reminders, calendar and notes• Apple Music or Spotify synched to your iPhone• Safety feature that includes ability to call an emergency service with the hold of a buttonOne downfall I have found is that the watch doesn’t hold a charge for long if you don’t have it on power reserve mode. It also loses power if you are not wearing it and it is not connected to the charging device. Overall, I am happy with my purchase and would recommend this product to others searching for a smart watch to digitally track your exercise, as well as use for many other daily uses.",B07K39FRSL,/gp/customer-reviews/R2R7OWNUBTMD9V/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07K39FRSL,"February 13, 2019",One

I like Apple products but I am definitely not an Apple acolyte. I refuse to buy a Mac but I like an iphone over an adroid.ask yourself what you want in wearable tech. If you want just a fitness tracker Fitbit is a much cheaper option and you can still get notifications and text messages. I bought this product because i needed a quick reference device for notifications and communications that also can track fitness. Makes sense? It’s a flip from fitbit.My former Fitbit’s battery lasted 3-5 days. My apple watch will last two days before going to 0%. However, if im not working out or receiving alot of texts, i have stretched it out to 3 days before 0% battery.It is very durable. It was recently cold soaked for two hours in a very heavy rain storm and still keeps on ticking without any glitches. It’s been banged around a few times and no scratches thus far. If you want to buy a face protector go ahead but i feel they make you feel like you need one to get more money out of you. And if you do buy a screen protector, dont get cheap cuz then they are just getting money of you with little return for your small investment.(Do yourself a favor and read up on the durability of cell phone, and smart watch, screens. More durable than you think)The band it comes with isnt bad but there are plenty of commercial options to customize.I purchased the non-cellular option becuase my phone is always with me at all times anyway. I didnt need to spend the extra on an option I didnt need.I would recommend avoiding the zoom text feature, though. It doesnt help you see small print, unless you like reading one word at a time, and it’s a pain to turn off.So, before you spend your hard earned cash. Think about WHY you want wearable tech and functions you desire. But i am very happy with this product.",B07K39FRSL,/gp/customer-reviews/R3TO3XXHNM9IJJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07K39FRSL,"January 27, 2019",13

As someone who bought this mainly for fitness tracking features, however, I was left incredibly disappointed. This is NOT a fitness watch.I excercise 1-2 hours daily, and I go on long hikes every month. I found myself having to charge this watch, at minimum, twice a day. I decided to test it during a day that I did a 1 hour long workout and a 4 hour long hike. It died halfway through my hike. This was a deal-breaker, since I got this watch mainly for the purposes of tracking my excercise activity. The Apple watch was insufficient for tracking the amount of excercise I preform on a daily basis, and unless you carry a battery pack, it's impractical for anyone who wants a dedicated fitness tracker. In addition, I found myself having to download multiple apps just to track calories and activity. This was a hassle.If your activity level is low and you're mainly interested in smartwatch features, then this may be the watch for you. It has a good built-in GPS, but be aware that it drains the battery very quickly thus rendering it useless. The heart-rate monitor seems to be accurate. This watch is not for anyone who is an athlete, as it dies ridiculously quickly when used for such purposes. I was so disappointed in the battery life of the Apple watch 3, that I don't even understand why Apple bothers calling it a tool for fitness tracking. They might as well just do away with the fitness tracking and simply make it a phone interface device, because that is what you'll get out of it: the ability to answer phone calls, messages, and control other phone apps. I know some who are not very physically active, and they are ecstatic with the Apple watch.  But if you're interested in seriously tracking fitness, then you're better off sticking to brands like Garmin and Fitbit.I replaced this with a Garmin Instinct, and am astounded with how much better the battery life and fitness features are. The Apple watch gets a lot of praise, but don't be so quick to believe the hype like I did or else you may end up disappointed too.",B07K39FRSL,/gp/customer-reviews/R1P3SI7EEJ1XEY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07K39FRSL,"March 26, 2019",4

After unsuccessfully trying one in the $60 range that came with inadequate, poorly translated instructions and stopped working within 24 hours of her opening it, we concluded that you probably get what you pay for. We decided to choose between a FitBit, and an Apple Watch. Since we’re both familiar with Apple products (as owners of iPhones, iPads, and an Apple TV) we decided to go with the Apple Watch. To save money, we got the older version (3rd gen) rather than the newest on the market. She’s only had it a few days, but so far it works great, and battery life is what you’d expect. The watch is good looking, my wife likes the intuitive operation and customizablity, and it integrates well with our current Apple products and our Philips Hue home lighting system. The wife loves it, and now that I’ve seen what it’s like, I’ve decided I want one too. The Apple Watch was the most expesive option we explored, but for current users of Apple products, it is well worth the price-You really do get what you pay for.

I went from having an android phone and a Fitbit Versa to switching to an iPhone then eventually to an Apple Watch to have the texting features back.I feel that the Apple Watch is easier to track workouts on and like not having just a step goal during the day.  I also like the tracking of outdoor walks/run better than the Fitbit.I do miss the sleep tracking function of the Fitbit Versa.

Common Sense Reviews,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AE5ACKUY6L6XAQ7LBQIFZVXILSKA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,Over glorified digital time on a pixelated screen.,1,Verified Purchase,Size: 42mmStyle: Silver Aluminum with White Sport Band,"There's nothing special about these watches. Besides receiving notifications, tracking your activity movement, and having cute screensavers on your wrist, this device is bulky and almost useless. It's overly complicated than what it should be with no immediate print instructions on how to work it, only finding out by much trial and error then finally looking it up on their site, and doesn't even have water coverage for rain. Someone else and myself decided to buy it together and in less than 24 hours later, their watch broke from the rain water leaking in their device while on a run. They were extremely underwhelming and despite all the widgets that could be added on top of its already existing software, it was borderline useless. We purchased just the GPS version. It's just a very limited miniature phone stats reader on your wrist which weigh you down. It may look fancy and sleek on boasting wise I suppose, but it's a heavy and fat little stump on your wrist. The heart rate is not even close to being accurate at all. There's no volume control for things outside of your classic pinger. The screen is bugged for receiving anything no matter what setting you place it in. The charge doesn't last long at all doing absolutely nothing, the whole 8+ hour charge is false. This thing sitting on top of my desk completely drained itself in a few hours without any consumption in storage, usage or connection. I have other activity bands that cost but a fraction of these prices and nearly do all the same things, for the lower end models. It's absurd someone would spent half a grand or more over a new series 4 edition. The only real practicality of it is if you don't want to carry your phone on a short gas station chore around the corner, or a quick GPS tracker for your walk around the neighborhood. That's it. And even then, you have to pay an addition fee for Cellular as you all might know, but paying the extra $10+ a month isn't worth it at all. And don't get a drop of water on it or it'll break. The speaker is low in phone calls, and you can't even type a reply if you need to. I had very high expectations and was very glad to receive my own set, to be let down very quickly. I wouldn't spend more than $150 on this. I could continue on more elaborate detail but that's there to name a few. Seriously, unless you're bathing in diamonds with blocks of gold as your tub, don't burn your cash on this.

We were looking for good fitness watches as well as accessories for our iPhones. She had a 7 plus and I have a 6S.First, the non-fitness aspects: It took roughly a month to really feel like I knew my watch fairly well. I use it a lot for notifications in meetings, quick responses when I’m on the road and for quickly pinging to find where my phone is. I also like it for the flashlight for times when I need to see but not have it too bright like getting ready in the morning before my wife and daughter wake up.Unfortunately, the voice to text is somewhat lacking compared to my iPhone 6S. I find the interpretation is often way off on many words and you can’t just go back and change a word like you can on a phone. You have to repeat the whole sentence.I also have trouble with getting Siri to auto trigger sometimes when I tilt my wrist up. I’m not sure why it works well sometimes and not at all other times.The battery life is decent but I wish it could run longer for a watch. I feel like 2 days and maybe half a day more is the max you can go without charging it. It does charge fairly quickly though. I think around 2 hours.I also wish there were more customizable faces. I can’t find the perfect face with everything I want on it. Animation, rings, weather, time, date and quick workout access.Overall, I’d rate this watch about a 3 & 1/2 stars for its non-fitness aspects. If the Siri worked better and talk to text worked better I would probably give it another star. Also, sometimes it’s hard to hear me if I’m in my car as well as hear other people on it. It’s still a good accessory though.Now, onto the fitness aspects of the watch.I loved this watch for fitness reasons when I first got it. It inspired me to workout more and around Feb I began completing my workout goals (rings) and actually begin losing weight. It helped me to lose 20 lbs. yay!It wasn’t until about a month ago I started having issues. What happened? It stopped giving me credit for some of my exercises. For example, I went on a 23 minute walk outside today with the Outside walk workout running and got 11 minutes of credit for it. I have since researched the issue to find out this was done on purpose by Apple. Or so they are claiming.What’s going on? Apple has an algorithm that apparently determines your heart rate, speed of walking and health information and if you don’t meet the minimum for a “brisk walk” then you don’t get credit for it in the exercise minutes. What idiot at apple decided this was a good idea? A healthy heart will have a lower beat rate but it doesn’t mean you aren’t exercising for that duration. This puts me off tremendously and I feel there needs I be a choice for the user to turn this auto calculation off and be able to use the workouts as they were before the change was made.Apple even gives a work around for this issue that makes no sense to me. They say just use the “other” workout and it will count as workout time. But what about the distance? The gps map? The ability to track how many walks you’ve taken and for how long? I feel like they’ve brushed it off and not addressed the issue here at all and that attitude towards the consumer’s concerns is a major turn off for me. What should be a solid 4-5 star fitness watch is now a 1 star fitness watch until this is addressed by apple.Until then, I can not recommend this watch as a fitness accessory. It’s a decent accessory to the iPhone if you need it for the non-fitness reasons.",B07K39FRSL,/gp/customer-reviews/R2JZNKHTI0DZRE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07K39FRSL,"April 7, 2019",2

Evelyn,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGWVDMYC5AYXNFH2GX7KGN4NJQEQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,"Bricked on update; thrown under the bus by Apple ""Care""",1,,Size: 38mmStyle: Silver Aluminum with White Sport Band,"Initially I loved this watch. I purchased it for the haptic alerts, as I frequently miss phone calls when my phone's in my bag or another room. For a brief time the watch was well suited to this purpose, and also quite handy for step tracking and fitness motivation.Sadly, after using the watch for a year, I became aware of a fatal flaw with the product. As a result, I’m now the proud owner of a bricked watch, with no remedy in sight from Apple. The flaw is a little-known issue with software updates. As the watch has no externally facing ports, WatchOS is initially installed prior to the watch case being sealed. In each WatchOS update, the OS carefully replaces itself with the new version. If anything goes amiss during a critical stage of the update (like hitting the cancel button, a lack of network connectivity, power failure, or nudging the watch off the magnetic charger), the watch is potentially left with the red exclamation mark of death (pictured) - and, assuming a hard reset fails, no possible means of ever restoring a working OS onto the watch again.In some instances where this happens, Apple quietly takes the watch and replaces it with a brand new one, hoping that customers will be so relieved about this wasteful ""fix"" that they don't mention the dirty little design flaw to too many other people. This is all fine and dandy if you're still within the one year warranty period, and you don't move away from the place of purchase. HOWEVER, if your watch borks itself during the update following the one year mark, OR you happen to have the misfortune of moving to a region with a subtly different model (which I regrettably did), you can expect to be up the creek. This happened to my watch at the 14 month mark. Now, after four maddening weeks of Apple ""Care"" stuffing me around and sending me on a 3-hour goose chase to my nearest Apple Store, I'm left with a useless device and a slap-in-the-face voucher for $45 off a new one (thanks, but no thanks!).If the red exclamation mark of death ever happens to you, you need to be aware and informed about your rights. Apple will probably try to tell you that your device had a pre-existing but somehow previously unseen hardware issue, and that they aren’t obliged to help you 1) after 12 months or 2) outside the country of purchase. What you need to know is: 1) Apple is legally obliged to provide you with working SOFTWARE for your device EVEN AFTER the 12 month US hardware warranty period has expired, and 2) this is often only a hardware problem of Apple's own making. It was Apple's own design choice to seal the case, preventing simple software issues from being remedied in software alone - and Apple must assume responsibility for the absurd consequence that a partially-installed OS results in a permanently bricked device. Given Apple's woeful track record of accepting responsibility for glaring design flaws, I predict this will once again end in a consumer class action - just like the infamous failure-prone MacBook butterfly keyboards and the self-shredding MagSafe power adaptors. Hell, there's at least one class action already on this very model of Apple Watch - related to cracking and shattering of screens. Caveat emptor - buyer beware!",B07K39FRSL,/gp/customer-reviews/R1LSR7ZDFPLR20/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07K39FRSL,"January 23, 2019",2

I am very pleased with this product and everything that it includes. At first, I was skeptical about having another device and worried about it distracting me, but there is something about this that makes phone usage so much more convenient. When I’m busy multitasking, I can quick glance at the message I just received or see who’s calling to make sure I actually want to answer it. With this newest Apple Watch, I am able to pick up a phone call without having my phone actually on me. I am able to monitor and watch my health through this watch too, completing each ring on the watch ensures that I am not spending my entire day sitting around.Pros:• Send and receive text messages• Siri• Fitness tracking• Alarms and Notes• Reminders• Interchangeable bands to match anything• GPSThe GPS is probably my favorite part about the watch. While I am going somewhere, instead of having to hold my phone in front of me, the Apple Watch vibrates and speaks when it is time to turn or take an exit. This makes driving somewhere new much more convenient and also much more safe than holding my phone in front of my face. With the fitness aspect, if I have been sitting for more than an hour, it will remind me to stand up. It also tracks my steps and calories that I burned throughout the day as well. Another huge bonus about the Apple Watch is that it is able to send a call to my phone if I misplace it and vice versa. The battery life of the watch is great, I have gone 3 days without charging it and it’s still on and fully functional.As for some downfalls, it can be just another device to have around that you may not actually need. This is not a necessity, it is a luxury to have an Apple Watch. If you set it up, you will receive social media notifications but are not able to scroll through the actual website. To ensure that you won’t be bothered by these notifications, just don’t log on to the social media site on the watch; unless you want the notifications.Overall, I love this product and highly recommend it to anyone that is skeptical about purchasing one.
