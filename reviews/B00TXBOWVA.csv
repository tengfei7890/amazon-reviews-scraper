C. Marvin,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHHOFEKSODNLVIKTLW56KA7O4X5Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,"Awesome speaker, no lifespan",3,Verified Purchase,Style: New,"As far as Bluetooth speakers go, the UE Megaboom KICKS. I've owned two of these and have used them paired together and separately for about 2 years.These are compact enough to fit in the cup holders on my backpack, but they still pump out some serious volume across the spectrum. The bass is enough to not feel flat, but it could be a smidge deeper. The rest of the spectrum shines through.Where these speakers really hit the mark is when they're paired together. They pair in stereo so they have a left and right channel. I had them on opposite sides of a 25ish x 15ish room and it was the next best thing to having actual surround sound. I would place them in my backpack cupholders on opposite sides of one another when I longboarded and it was phenomenal.Here's the bad:They're inconsistent with charging, even when using the official UE charger. Sometimes they simply won't charge despite the charging light indicating it is. Sometimes that light won't even come on and you have to factory reset the device multiple times for it to work. Occasionally that won't even work, and trying days later the speaker miraculously works again. I can't explain it, but I've gone through two of these and they've both experienced this.Pairing both speakers together through the UE app is inconsistent at best. Pairing one speaker will sometimes unpair the other. It seldom worked on the first attempt. If you received a phone call while they both paired, one of the speakers would unpair and you'd have to undergo the pairing process through the app again. This was on an iPhone 7 Plus.This isn't that bad of an issue, but more of a pet peeve. Even if the device is turned completely down, the ""device voice"" for low battery will be at seemingly max volume as will be the chime that plays when you turn it on.The really bad:I left the speaker unattended while charging (my fault), and when I came back, the mini USB connector had MELTED INTO THE CHARGING PORT. The shielding around the wire and mini USB connector melted into the material around the port. It was so melted together it took a decent amount of effort with a knife to cut it away. I was not home when this occurred, but thankfully it didn't start a major fire and was cool to the touch when I found it. All products used were from the UE Megaboom box. There were no 3rd party components.All-in-all, I might actually purchase two of these again if the price drops. If it wasn't for the potential fire or the charging issues I've had with these, they would EASILY get five stars.",B00TXBOWVA,/gp/customer-reviews/R332SJC1IN71E9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TXBOWVA,"January 5, 2019",22

Because the way it’s charged is you have to turn it upside down and most of the time you have to keep it on the charger unless you plan on the day or week you are going to use it.

The device does seem to be quite resistant to water, but the claim that it's shock proof turned out to be untrue in my experience.  I used it while doing yard work, tubing down a river, as an extension of Amazon Alexa, and one fateful night, while in a hot tub.  Having it submerge in water that night, as with the river trip as mentioned, was no problem at all.  The issue turned out to be that a drop from a height of 3 feet (top edge of hot tub where it fell from is almost exactly 36 inches off the ground) to the concrete patio below was enough to make the device turn off and never turn on again.I looked up the shockproof claim and it's 1 meter (3.28 feet).  I also looked up the warranty and it's 2 years.  Being that mine was purchased mid-2017, I decided to see what Logitech (bought UE in 2008) support would do for me.  I read a good number of complaints online about online support (chat, email) and some suggestions to call phone support instead, so I started there.  I was on the phone with technical support for about 15-20 minutes before the rep said she had received approval to replace the device.  Another 10-15 minutes or so (33.5 minutes total) to wrap up shipping and notation.  I'm supposedly being sent a replacement device and am told I'll get an email in the next 24 hours with UPS shipping information.

I have yet to take it to the beach but am not worried about the sand since it is waterproof. The phone app is really cool and is easy to use. Integration with Alexa is convenient, easy and cool.

Volume buttons works great and don't accidentally get pushed really ever.It's tough and doesn't seem to mar or scratch easily.

RustyBolts,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEAP3Z3KORY3FIGXCLGEEZICNRHA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,Ultimate Cycling Speaker,5,Verified Purchase,Style: New,"Megabooms are the ultimate cycling speaker! The overall mix of loud volume, tight upper bass at high volume, lack of distortion (dynamic compression) at high volume, battery life, and waterproof case makes this a clear winner.Party Up Mode: With the app you can pair 2 (up to 50) of these and play off a single phone! I've had 4 hooked up at once at a camp site and its a crowd pleaser. People will stop and ask you what speaker it is.. not because its loud, or even that the sound quality is mind-blowing.. Mostly because of the sound stage you get from having stereo sound (L and R speaker in different locations) in an unexpected location (not a house). Don't underestimate the additional sound quality you get from having the drums and bass in the left speaker and vocals and lead guitar in the right. Especially at a camp site or backyard BBQ. Especially when one speaker is on your bike and the other is on your wife's bike and you pass someone by going around them (one on each side) and they get a brief couple seconds of stereo sound, and are completely confused how you're playing 2 speakers at once. A good sound stage delivers you an experience where you can visually place each instrument, and this feature allows you to do this just about anywhere. That alone makes this product incredible that you can do so just about anywhere. You can also do a party mode where you let as many people as possible create a public playlist through the app.. Cool stuff. Also, bluetooth range is amazing (when you have line of sight).Ok, think multiple speakers is a gimmick and you won't buy 2? Fine. Its still an solid speaker if you only own 1. The bass is not the deepest out there (JBL Charge 2+ better bass, but not waterproof and doesn't get very loud). If you want an outdoor speaker that has pretty good bass, high volume, waterproof, and low distortion at high volume there's not anything else out there that checks all the boxes. Its case is robust so it makes for the perfect outdoor/cycling speaker. Oh, and the battery life exceeded my expectations by several hours.. or should I say days. I hoped I could get through an entire day of RAGBRAI (7 day bike ride across Iowa) at 3/4 to full volume. It lasted 3 days at 6-7 hours per day (not always at full volume, but at least half, usually 3/4). I think the battery is only like 2600mAh, but the speaker uses 2 x 2"" drivers and 2 x 4"" passive radiators, which is why you get the awesome battery life with only a 2600 mAh battery. Not to get too techy, but passive radiators use air pressure trickery from drivers and allows massive bass without actually powering the ""bass speakers"", so to speak. Look up ""passive radiators"".. cool tech. Ok, I'm in the weeds here.Mounting is a little awkward on a road bike since its bigger than most. I just stretched out my metal water bottle cage and added a velcro strap. Stays in place well enough for road biking at 20-30 mph. The internet mostly recommended the Topeak cage to mount a Megaboom to a bike, but I found it to be even more awkward and too tight, resulting in unnecessary rubbing and scuffing of my Booms. Emphasis on ROAD BIKE, not mountain bike. Your results may vary jumping off rocks from 5'. Tap Control doesn't work very well.. Tap top of speaker twice for skip, once for play pause, and pulling out your phone is a pain. Your life will immediately improve if you buy a media button for cycling (Satechi Bluetooth Button <--- what I bought).In a nutshell, if you're looking for a cycling speaker that also sounds good when you get to the campsite, this is it! After buying 2 for cycling only it was so good I removed my large 250W Yamaha receiver and Micca speakers from my garage (took up too much space) and I'm happy with 2 Megabooms. I also moved my back porch stereo (Audioengine A5+) to the basement because Megabooms sound great. I'm not saying that Megabooms sound as good as a full Yamaha setup or Audioengines, but they are good enough and the portability, versatility, and soundstage makes up for it.PROS:- Louder than anything out there- Battery Life is 3-4 days at least. I haven't charged mine in 2 weeks, including a weekend cycling trip.- Sound (perfect mix of tight upper bass, mids, highs not too bright)- Waterproof/durability (you can dunk in water for 30 min!)- Good app (turn speakers on/off with app, speaker firmware updates, stereo volume balance control)- Sound stage with 2 speakersCONS:- Price (Its a chunk of change to buy 2, but if you cycle as much as me, just use the gas money saved)- Tap Control (you're supposed to be able to tap on top of speaker twice to skip songs, once to pause/play..

To keep it simple, in my opinion it really depends on how you plan on using your speaker. I won't call myself a professional audiophile but I can definitely tell that the Bose has the best quality sound BUT I would actually only buy either the UE Megaboom or the Big Jambox. The reason I say this is because the UE Megaboom is by far the best portable speaker if you plan on taking it outside like the beach, park, etc. Not only is it shock proof but it's also waterproof up to 30 min in 1 meter of water. My speaker has been dropped off a table multiple times and just really abused and it's still going strong. The sound is great and gets loud with decent bass (not as loud as Big Jambox, more on that later). The battery life is great too as I can get more than 10 hours on the loudest setting. The unique part about the Megaboom is the 360 degree sound which is great for outdoors because you don't have to be directly in front of the speaker. The Bluetooth range is amazing too, I can go easily 50 feet and it does break up. There is nifty app in the iOS and Android store which you can do firmware updates and play with the settings. Now if you want the loudest speaker in this category, the Big Jambox is the loudest sounding speaker with good quality and bass. The reason for this is the speaker is front facing so if you're standing in front of it, this thing can really blast some tunes with bass. The Bose doesn't come close to being as loud. Even though this is the loudest with good quality speaker, I would still only buy this for inside use or for use in a back patio. The design of the speaker is not built for taking to the beach or anywhere it could fall. Plus in large outdoor spaces the UE Megaboom's 360 degree sound is great. Finally back to the Bose, I wouldn't buy this speaker because it's not as loud as the Big Jambox and it's not as rugged as the Megaboom. Overall the UE Megaboom is my favorite speaker to play n my office and then I grab it and take wherever because Aof it's ruggedness!",B00TXBOWVA,/gp/customer-reviews/R1LE6FRAXNQT6M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TXBOWVA,"March 25, 2016",3

I bought the Megaboom after buying the Boom II. I'll add a quick comparison overview at the end of this review.Short review: (scroll down for pros and cons) Excellent sound, excellent quality, and easy to use! 9.5/10Overview:The Megaboom is hands down the best wireless speaker I have owned.Utility: I bought it to use at several beach/river trips I had coming up during the summer. I tested to see if it actually floats in the pool, and it does! I threw it in, but it does takes a few seconds to resurface, but eventually it made its way back up. I clipped a carabiner and added a float device on as well so it would resurface quickly if anything happened, then hooked it to my tube and floated the river for 6 hours without any issues. I dunked it in the water a few times to show off a bit and everyone was impressed. I've taken it to the beach and set it in the sand and let it play. I even took it to a natural spring to hang out with friends. It is an absolute blast to be able to toss around the speaker and skip songs, or use the voice function to play a different one. Mostly I use this in the shower/bathroom when getting ready in the morning, and I typically have to charge it every 3-4 weeks, which is absolutely amazing!Sound: I am blown away by the sound from this wireless speaker. I have gotten compliments on it just about everywhere I bring it. I've already talked two people into buying it! The app does a great job of having some good pre-set sound settings (extra bass, voice boost for podcasts, etc.). The sound is extremely loud and can fill a room indoors. Outdoors it is loud enough to have a good time, without worrying about it easily being drown out. My only real complaint is that it seems to overheat in the sun and shut down after a few hours of direct sunlight, so I would quickly fix this by placing it under a beach chair or something similar.Pros:Shockproof!! (I dropped this (about 4 feet) in my bathroom on a tile floor and had a minor freak out knowing I joke broke my expensive speaker, but it just kept playing, no issues at all!)Waterproof/floatsVoice controlled audioExtremely strong soundMobileApp controlled/remote turn onVariable audio settingsLong battery life (sometimes I go 3-4 weeks without charging)Bluetooth range is extremely strong (I'll carry it with my as I do chores on different floors of the house without losing signal from my phone)Cons:Shuts down when in direct sunlightBattery life is a bit shorter when using at full volume outsideLong charge time (although can still be used while charging)Some people may say that the price point is a con, but you get what you pay for. This is a solid speaker that is worth every penny for the outdoor enthusiast!Megaboom vs Boom III initially bought the Boom II and absolutely loved it. I used it mostly indoors, and have zero complaints. The sound quality is great, but outdoors, is where the Megaboom really shines. If you are mostly indoors in smaller rooms, the Boom II is more than powerful enough. However, if you have large open areas, or are outdoors, always pick the Megaboom!",B00TXBOWVA,/gp/customer-reviews/RQF98OS2TWUWV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TXBOWVA,"September 26, 2016",One

I use it in a noisy environment at work and it's generally loud enough. My biggest gripe was that for a while I couldn't get it to take a charge, factory reset wouldn't fix it and I couldn't get it to update either. Finally when the battery was at ""critical charge"" I just factory reset it 3 times in a row, tried to update again and it finally worked. It now charges normally but I don't know if it will act up again. After the reset and update actually took hold the battery mysteriously went from ""critical charge"" level to 40%, this was not using the reading on my phone but when I pressed and held both volume buttons, the speaker itself tells you how charged it is. As a note this thing at max volume uses more juice than the charger can charge it with and will still slowly drain the battery. My equipment at work gets very loud which is why I need the max volume, your mileage may vary on this point.

After listening to many types of music in different settings, I am very impressed. The equaliser works very well for achieving a desired balance between low, mid, and high frequencies, and the speaker can be oriented and postioned to further fine tune the sound. The bass reproduction is great, hitting all but the very lowest of frequencies. In some listening environments (high pitched background noise, for example) bass is a bit ""boomy"" but is easily remedied with the equaliser. The maximum volume is quite high, with minimal noticable compression (sound doesn't change when you crank it up!).As for features, the battery life is incredible. I use it around 6 hours per day, for 3 days before charging, and it usually has nearly 20% battery left. The range seems to be less than advertised, but is still very good. I haven't tested water proofing but Google images shows lots of brave people running water over it, putting it in fish tank, etc. The App works great and has never crashed on my android phone. The app gives equaliser controls and remote power option (and more), but is not required to have it running to connect or play music. The speaker connects almost immediately after being powered on, every time.As a nice touch, different sounds play for power on/off and connect/disconnect, and an audible battery level can be summoned anytime by pressing volume buttons simultaneously. This is really helpful since the speaker has no display itself.Overall this is a great product, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a premium quality bluetooth speaker with great sound and battery life, plus the protection offered by being water proof.",B00TXBOWVA,/gp/customer-reviews/R1R3442SNRJE0P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TXBOWVA,"August 5, 2015",4

Decent volume, but really doesn't get loud enough just playing inside the house. Not a very rich sound no matter how I tried to adjust the equalizer. Pre-set settings do not sound good, either. When you select the option to add more bass, it simply sounds like the music is muffled. Compared to other speakers I own, this one is just average. Probably more comparable to a $80-$100 speaker.

The app has a full equalizer with a few presets and a fully customizable treble and base range. It even allows you to apply firmware updates via the phone, and to easily change other settings on the speaker, such as pairing it with multiple devices at the same time. I love that it is battery powered, and comes with a brightly colored usb charging cable and adapter block. It also has a nice portable size and a hang loop for versatility. The bluetooth range is really good.I do not love the sound, for this price and for the reviews it has gotten I expected a fuller sound. It is bright and a little hissy, and the bass simply will not kick it. It also has a design flaw... if you turn the speaker on its end, the weight of the speaker presses the bluetooth button so you lose the signal. In other words, no you can't charge it while standing it on its end.For anyone who was wondering, there is absolutely no comparison between this speaker and the Fluance Fi50. The sound on the Fluance is much fuller, cleaner, and more pleasing.  I tried comparing rap, jazz, and salsa on both devices and across the board the Fluance sounds better than the Megaboom.

I'm going to  copy/paste straight from the product listing.1. ""Freakishly amazing 360-degree sound with deep bass"" - In my experience there was not deep bass. The bass was very thin and sometimes inaudible.2. ""100 ft Bluetooth wireless range, 20-hour rechargeable battery* and ultra-fast micro USB charging (* Actual wireless range and battery life will vary with use, settings and environmental conditions)"" In my experience I got 5 hours of playback, not 20. I did my best to extend the playback time by connecting through a physical audio cable and turning off Bluetooth, but it didn't help. Neither did I experience ultra-fast USB charging. In my experience it took over 2 hours of USB charging before the unit was able to be powered up.The main reason that I'm disappointed with the unit is the short 5 hour playback time. I wanted to use these speakers at work. My work day is usually 10 hours. Since the listing promised 20 hours of playback, I expected it to easily last through my entire daily work shift. It did not.Besides that, I'm disappointed with the sound quality. I realize that small speakers will never give you the full sound that even a 5"" speaker can deliver, but the listing RAVES about how great it sounds. In my experience the sound quality was just OK. And the price! At this price point I certainly expected better.There are a couple of things that I was impressed with. The Bluetooth range is quite good. And it certainly is loud. But that's it.But I bought  a different wireless speaker unit made by TaoTronics called ""Boom X"" that has much better sound quality than the UE MegaBOOM. I use it at home, mostly in my bedroom. I tested them side by side, and the TaoTronics had better bass and just better overall sound quality than the UE MegaBOOM. I bought the TaoTronics Boom X in May, 2016 for $60. I just checked the price and the very same TaoTronics unit is currently selling on amazon for $36. For that price, the TaoTronics Boom X is an absolute steal.Here is a link to the listing:https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-TaoTronics-Subwoofers-Aluminum-Alloy-Microphone/dp/B013WPIGUA/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1484159159&sr=8-3&keywords=taotronics+bluetooth+speaker",B00TXBOWVA,/gp/customer-reviews/R5V1LGG69JFQ3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TXBOWVA,"January 11, 2017",

My friend has a Beats Pill, can't even come close to comparing to the quality sound and the lows this speaker produces. The sound level is high enough that I can hear it while driving my side by side. But that's not really what its for, and you can't crank it up over all the road noise etc, but it's plenty loud for such a small package. The battery lasts an amazingly long time as well. I would definitely recommend this speaker, and may even be getting a second one to pair. Works phenomenally in my steam shower. I'm surprised how much I use it, and where I take it. Time will tell how it stands up to my abuse, but I'm betting it will work out just fine for me, and I know exactly which brand name I will use to replace it. The sound quality is so good, I wouldn't be happy with another brand now.

It showed 40% charge off the get go (actually the app doesn't say the %, but the + and - can be pressed to announce it) and then plugged in the yellow charger to the wall and the yellow micro-USB cable to the Megaboom, but no LED light came on and the app didn't change to show it was charging.Checked the cable with another charger and a Kindle for my kid, and that worked so the cable is fine.Tried the 12V charger on an old Sony Handycam and it charged fine.So the unit itself is the issue and it was sent back.Update on 8-9-16:  New unit arrived (1 day shipping) and charges out of the gate.

I bought it to use with my mac (cuz I'm old and make playlists for parties and play them through iTunes, as opposed to playing them from my phone). Anyway, I put the speaker on top of a tall (7') book shelf in the corner of one of the rooms in my open-plan house and it sounded great in that room, one room over in either direction, and two rooms over in either direction. I mean it sounded really great! And I did not have to blast it. It's as if the sound waves just magically moved through the house without diminishing. The battery is also no joke: I charged the speaker up, which did not take long since it arrived mostly charged, and ran it via Bluetooth for eight hours nonstop about 40 feet from my computer (and through two walls). When I checked the battery power at the end of the night, expecting it to be around 40%, I was shocked when it told me it was at 80% power. It took a lot less than an hour to charge it back up to 100%. I haven't even commented on its design, which is flawless. I got the one in black. It looks so unassuming and classic: then it creates this stupendous sound! It cost 300 smackers, but so did every other high quality wireless speaker I looked at, and none of them looked this good or featured this kind of battery life. According to the Interwebs, you can even drop this speaker in the pool and it will be A-OK. I cannot say enough good things about this speaker! I did buy the extended warranty because a few folks on here said they had problems with this speaker's predecessor after a year or so.  I also had to go to YouTube to figure out how to open the packaging to get at the actual speaker- duh- and how to use the speaker, but, like I said, I'm kinda old, so I'm used to doing that kind of thing.

The speaker was encased in a hard plastic case that was cyndrilical. The charger was tucked away in a neat little compartment. Suffice it to say,  I knew the speaker was going to be great right from the moment I opened it.Upon opening the package I powered on the  speaker which was fully charged upon arrival. It took about 5 seconds to connect to my phone and wow. The sound was incredible.

The weak linkage often results in clipping in one or both speakers which really ruins the sound.Distance isn't the issue. This issue occurs when the distance from my I-phone to either speaker is only 10 feet and in the same room. Interference isn't an issue as I've moved the speakers around and still experience difficulty linking two and clipping.If I were rating just one speaker I'd give 5 stars.

Stay there and read this review!,5,Verified Purchase,Style: New,"This is the best portable speaker on the market. My boyfriend and I were between the Bose Soundlink III and this. We bought both and tested them out ourselves. Here's what we found:Bose:Clearer, sharper tone at lower volumes, but became muddled and distorted at the louder volumes.UE Megaboom:Sounds a bit weak at a lower volume, but this is only because of the 360 design. The speaker sounds great at lower volumes when placed near a corner. When you turn this thing all the way up its crystal clear and completely fills a large room.Not only is it a better speaker, but it's more durable, so you can take it to the beach/pool/etc. The Bose is much more delicate.**UPDATE** DON'T BUY IT!!!About a week in to having this speaker, I turned it up pretty loud and I could've sworn something had blown. It sounded strange. I decided to ignore it and press on, but then at an event I was hosting I had TWO of these suckers on full blast and had someone come up to me and it was barely breaking over the sound of the crowd. It was an open, square studio space with decent acoustics... I had someone come up to me and ask if they could go any louder. No. The answer was no. TWO ""Mega""booms ($500 worth of stereo equipment) could barely carry a room of 20 people.I went on the hunt again and found the Marshall Kilburn speaker. Much, much better. Gonna spend about $50 more for it, but it's worth it. It's much better than the Megaboom. The problem is that any portable bluetooth speaker just can't deliver what a speaker that plugs in to the wall can give you. I bought the Marshall Kilburn and the Marshall Woburn. The Woburn is out of this world. The sexiest sound I've ever heard from a personal speaker. The Kilburn is a magnificent portable bluetooth speaker.After trying all of the top brands (Bose, Megaboom, Jambox, Marshall) It's a definite with the Marshall Kilburn.",B00TXBOWVA,/gp/customer-reviews/R2Y8MFKBYYVBEX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TXBOWVA,"March 28, 2016",One

The Megaboom can seem a bit too big for some but in my opinion it is the perfect size. The genius design of this speaker allows it to deliver a nice loud and punchy sound with a relatively small form factor. The 360° soundstages allows it to fill a room with no problem without having to fidget around trying the get a ""perfect spot"" for the audio playback. When it first arrived I carefully examined the speaker to see the build quality. I found a spot that worried me since the cloth mesh did not cover and seal a part of my unit, however, I decided to test it's waterproofing and specifically in that area. I found no problems and the speaker continued to work great. This speaker gets really loud and that is big plus since I bought it for the purpose of using to get people hyped up for some football games. As great as the loudness can be the only downside I see about this speaker that keeps me from giving it a five star rating is it's battery life. The official documentation suggests a 20 hour battery life on a full charge. In my testing the speaker could surpass 20 hours on mid volume to low volume, however if you crank it up to 100% the speaker will last for about 7 hours. Now this is probably not a problem for most people but I did expect to get a bit more juice. Overall this is my favorite speaker by far. Many prefer the JBL extreme and while I have to agree that sound quality may be better, there is no denying that the UE Megaboom just has better portability and still delivers a great sound.",B00TXBOWVA,/gp/customer-reviews/RDKFT7OMUSLV6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TXBOWVA,"September 18, 2017",One

I purchased the MegaBoom to have music out by the pool, and it's sturdy enough, has great sound, and it's plenty loud enough to fill that purpose perfectly. I'm a bit disappointed in Bluetooth's range, but the MegaBoom's Bluetooth connects easily to every gadget I've got: desktop PCs, laptops, 'Droid phone, and my Kindle. Since WiFi has a better range, I just use either my phone or my Kindle at the pool over my home's WiFi signal running a Pandora stream, and that feeds the MegaBoom.

Logitech has not done anything to fix it!I've had one of these for about 7 months now and even bought a second one so that i could use the ""Party up"" feature to use them in stereo.  I'll start off by saying that the audio quality is very good on these speakers!  There is no complaint for me on that.However, the recent update to the android app is has almost completely disabled advertised functionality of the speakers.  To be specific:1) In order to use both speakers in stereo, I have to unpair/repair the speakers EVERY time i use them.  Otherwise, the UE Megaboom app will not recognize that they are connected.  I've had the same problem with three different android devices now, so it's not my phone!  So, if you plan on using two of them, get ready for a giant hassle.2) The previous version of the app allowed for power up and power down of the speakers from your phone.  They have removed this function from the most recent version of the app with no warning.  If i had known they were going to do this, i would have blocked the app update on my phone.  To me, this is one of the more attractive features, since im not always sitting right next to my speaker.3) The most recent SPEAKER update succeeds in the app but the app tells you that it failed and that you have to update via USB.  When you update via USB, it tells you the speaker is already up to date.  This identical issue happened with BOTH of my speakers.Before you buy these, go look at the reviews of the UE Megaboom app on the google play store and you will see that this is a problem that EVERYONE is having, yet Logitech has refused to address the issue.Bottom line, these are great sounding speakers with HORRIBLE support from logitech...almost to the point of rendering the speakers useless!  I highly recommend NOT buying these until Logitech addresses the unacceptable flaws in their app!",B00TXBOWVA,/gp/customer-reviews/R1342UQUXHE9ZU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TXBOWVA,"December 5, 2016",6

I also only used this product 5-6 times during that couple of months. I purchased this item less than a year ago and now it won't charge pass 40%. One day, it just decided that it wouldn't charge at all. I would charge it for hours and it would still be at 0%. I looked online, read reviews, read blogs, watched YouTube videos and even went to the ultimate ears website (which offered no help). I found a couple videos on YouTube of people resetting their speaker, so I tried that and now it won't go past 40%. The bottom charging light indicator will also not light up anymore.What stinks the worst? Amazon won't even give me the option to return or replace this defective device. I honestly logged on to try and either return or replace it, since it does advertise a 2-year warranty and it hasn't even been a year.I have seen so many people post online about having the same issue but I haven't found a legitimate fix. If you are interested in buying this product, just google ""UE Megaboom won't charge"" and you will find countless situations like mine. There are a few videos that claim they found the fix, all they recommend is a factory reset, which didn't work for me or a lot of other people.In my opinion, don't even consider buying this product.

Judging by the other reviewers they seem to like it but compared to Bose it is no where near as warm, as accurate, as detailed and has no where near the base. The base of the Megaboom is boomy for sure, remind me of an old school ported subwoofer that doesn't hit the low frequencies at all but does a decent job of fooling you to believe it is.

Until a recent firmware update, this product would have received 4 stars but I'm compelled to write a review due to my recent issue. Logitech Tech Support confirms that the new firmware update removes the ability to connect to two devices simultaneously, even though this is still advertised on their website as a feature (screenshot included). This advertised feature will probably be removed soon as I informed them of this misinformation. I'm truly disappointed that my device lost a feature that I enjoyed and utilized frequently. I would connect to both my laptop and phone simultaneously while working and if I began to use the other device, I would never have to reconnect to the speaker: it would automatically switch sources depending on my use. Now, I have to manually go into the settings of the device I'm using as it remembers only the device that I last had it connected to.Pros:• Loud as can be. One of these fills spacious rooms with 10 foot ceilings quite well for its size. I take it around the house with me depending on what room I feel like working in and I'm always pleased. It is superb in the close confines of the bathroom (shower jams are the best!).• Waterproofing has yet to fail me. After months of only permitting splashes, I summoned the bravado (and wanted to brag to my friends) and dunked it into the hot tub while it was playing music for over a minute. There was no disruption. I was very impressed.• Excellent battery life. I've never measured it, but I can go for several days before I charge it.• ""Bluetooth Smart"" is a very convenient feature from the phone utilizing Bluetooth 4.0 LE. I can lazily turn on my speaker from my phone's app without having to push the manual button (attached screenshot). I cannot notice a significant battery drain and I leave this on continuously.• The equalizer settings in the UE Megaboom app are useful - there are presets as well as customization of 5 frequency ranges (attached screenshot).Cons:• Aside from the firmware update mentioned, there is no AAC support which would provide better audio quality.• The fidelity is not great - especially on the higher frequencies. When listening to spoken audio (e.g. podcasts) I have to turn up the volume louder than I would like, even if I adjust the equalizer settings.Other observations:• I am not certain if this is due to a firmware update (oh the irony if it were) or my familiarity with the device, but the tap-to-pause/tap-to-skip function has become easier over time. Originally, I would attempt to double-tap the top (to skip to the next song) and it would only pause the song (as if it only registered one tap). This does not happen anymore.• Recharging the speaker almost demands their proprietary Micro USB cable due to the deep recessing of the port (ostensibly for waterproofing). This can be inconvenient if I do not have the cable with me as all others I have tried do not fit.I have never used the double-up feature because I don't have a second speaker nor do I know anyone who does. I sure would like to try it one day.This speaker is heavy but I chose the UE Megaboom for a reason - I wanted exceptional battery life, a loud volume, and waterproofing. I do a lot of car camping so this is what I was looking for most of all. With these three features, the UE Megaboom was a great choice.",B00TXBOWVA,/gp/customer-reviews/R36RDLQTDCUAZV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TXBOWVA,"November 1, 2016",21

K Larrabee,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGUEKU3ORYTD4TX7EB7LKRCDEPKQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,"Speaker is great, but the power adapter renders it useless - and dangerous",1,Verified Purchase,Style: New,"TL;DR - HUGE SAFETY CONCERNSAs a speaker, I really love the MEGABOOM. The volume and sound quality are about what I'd expect (or even hope) from this price point and format, and the simplicity of its design & controls means I don't spend time fiddling around with using it - I just use it and listen!The bluetooth connection is a little crappy, because it can sporadically lose connection to devices within 8 feet away, but it regains connection pretty quickly.What makes this a 1-star review though is the power adapter.My (now) wife and I ordered this a year ago to use for our small wedding reception. We received it, charged it, tested it, and used it for several hours' worth of streaming music during our wedding (pre-ceremony, cocktail hour, and reception). It worked out perfectly!We charged it a little (charge #2) and put it on the shelf, where it sat unused for probably 10 months, and we stored all peripherals (adapter components & cable) in the box it arrived in and put the box in a dry plastic bin in the closet.I started using the speaker again for occasional background music while I work about 2 weeks ago and have since charged it 2 more times (4-5 charges total across the year we've had it).Now, I am unable to charge this any further, as the power adapter SPARKS in every outlet we have tested it in (our apartment and elsewhere), and even leaving it in the outlet afterward (watching it the entire time) it cannot charge the speaker. The adapter sparks regardless of whether the speaker is plugged in or whether the USB cable is plugged into the adapter.The speaker charges via USB, but that USB cable cannot be plugged into any outlet <-> USB adapter - it requires the full power adapter. A power adapter that has been used about ~5 times and always stored properly/safely in between uses. Absolutely ridiculous.Needless to say, our UE MEGABOOM would be a fully-functional, great speaker - if we could charge it. Instead, it is now a paperweight.",B00TXBOWVA,/gp/customer-reviews/R226MNPNW6QUC2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TXBOWVA,"June 11, 2018",5

Jeffitz,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEQVMQISBWNYCKZNEQOWC3V2UAZQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,"Feature Rich, but Sound Quality Deficient When Compared to Soundlink III.",3,Verified Purchase,Style: New,"I had high expectations for the UE Megaboom since I was looking for something with more features and longer battery life to replace a Bose Soundlink III. Amazon had the charcoal version selling for over $100 off the normal price, and I thought that was a great time to try out the Megaboom since I'd read favorable reviews and liked the look of the design.I've been frustrated with the Soundlink III primarily because of the lack of features, most notably not being able to tell when it's reached max volume with an audible cue and the fact that it demands you hold the volume buttons down to change the volume rather than allowing incremental presses (why can't I take it to full, and then just back it off three presses?). The Soundlink III also only has a rudimentary light denoting battery level that doesn't give you more of an indication than low, medium or fully charged. I liked that the Megaboom has these relatively simple features. I liked that Logitech has an app for their speaker and that they appear to make firmware refinements, whereas I don't think Bose has done anything to update the Soundlink III to add some simple features despite having a dedicated USB port on the back for that purpose; even the Bose Mini II has more features than the dramatically more expensive Soundlink III.So, why only three stars for the Megaboom? Well, primarily audio quality. I'm odd in that I'm really not interested in a portable speaker through which to play music from a phone or tablet. I want to use it as a portable external speaker for my Traveler guitar using the AUX input. This use quickly demonstrated some shortcomings in the Megaboom.First, was that a strong bass note like the low E will make the Megaboom's speakers buzz and breakup at high volume. This does not happen with the Soundlink III, at any volume. The same goes for hitting muted power chords. The Megaboom just can't handle them gracefully the way the Bose speaker can. I should add here that the Megaboom is a bit louder than the Soundlink III at top volume, and when I lowered the volume of the Megaboom using a dB meter for a fair comparison the problem was less noticeable, but still there. When hitting a low E chord, the other higher notes helped to mask the buzzing from the bass note, but it was still there if you listened closely. I also tried using the equalizer in the Megaboom app, and the ""Custom"" equalizer setting knocked the bass back a bit emphasizing the mids and alleviated the buzz at the highest volume, but not still not entirely. When listening to music, you'd probably notice this while listening to any music at higher volumes with a strong bass line. This would bother me. Again, the bass on the Soundlink III remained clear and defined at all volumes without having to try and manipulate anything. I want to add here that the Bose Soundlink Mini II exhibited the same raspy buzz when confronted with deep bass notes that sounds very similar to that of the Megaboom, so I sort of feel like the Megaboom has a sound quality similar to that of the much less expensive Soundlink Mini II, while only offering a little more in terms of volume.The second thing I noticed was that there was a noticeable delay of about a 1/8 second from striking a note on the guitar to hearing it through the Megaboom, and this was through the AUX input, not via bluetooth. I can only imagine that the delay through bluetooth would be even more noticeable. I guess the Megaboom's doing quite a bit of processing to the music, even to an uncompressed source coming in through the aux input. I'm sure there is somewhat of a delay using the Soundlink III and Mini II as well, but it wasn't discernible and I'd be likely to drive myself mad trying to hear it. So, if someone's application for the Megaboom speaker demands low latency (as in viewing video with audio), then it would probably be a disappointment. For simply listening to music, it would be fine.The third failing I noticed was while being paired with my iPhone 7. While paired, the Megaboom issued at high pitched hum/squeal. Not something you'd hear from a few feet away, but up close (2-3)' and without any music playing it was audible. The sound would immediately disappear when I unpaired the speaker from my phone. Didn't experience anything like this with the Soundlink III or Mini II.While I found the physical design of the Megaboom aesthetically pleasing, when placed horizontally, the cylindrical Megaboom obviously will want to roll. If you intend to use the AUX input and/or charge it while in use, you are basically forced to place the speaker into this horizontal position. Not really a big deal since it does find a resting place when the rubber strip along the side with the volume buttons settles onto a flat surface. However, in that position you want the speaker grill facing you, but that means the volume controls are now faced both away from you and slightly underneath the speaker which makes them hard to get to, to the point where I found myself having to pick the speaker up to change the volume. I'm pretty certain I would always find that annoying. You could place the speaker on end with the AUX and USB inputs facing up, but then the power and Bluetooth buttons are entirely underneath the speaker, which isn't ideal either.Overall, I'd say that if you're using the Megaboom at low levels in a quiet environment, these issues would probably not be issues, nor would they be if you're using it in a loud environment at higher volumes where a lot of ambient noise would drown the deficiencies. My intended use was a bit more demanding than that from a sound quality perspective. If the many features of the Megaboom, durability, and considerably longer battery life are really important to you, then I'd say it's a decent choice. For my purposes with the Traveler guitar, the Bose Soundlink III was clearly and immediately the better choice in terms of sound quality, so I guess I'm stuck with the niggling little deficiencies of that speaker for a while longer.",B00TXBOWVA,/gp/customer-reviews/RNQ2LO856UCI6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TXBOWVA,"March 3, 2017",3

He turned down the music so we could actually hear each other, and so I could get a closer look at this amazing speaker. Let me tell you, this thing is so load and has such amazing bass for a portable speaker! I was blown away.I promptly purchased on off of Amazon and am so glad I did. Since this has a hook for a carabeaner, I was able to attach it to the top of my gazebo with a pulley. I can now jam out in my backyard while this thing pumps out music link no one's business! The 360 degree sound is awesome, and the companion app is a nice touch. SO excited for years of great music from this thing.",B00TXBOWVA,/gp/customer-reviews/R25P7UNC2XN80H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TXBOWVA,"September 2, 2016",3

John T.,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AE2LP2C3MIP26BUTS42LA7H76PNA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,Would be a 5 star review if not for their customer service.| But the more I use I realize it's just not a great product,2,Verified Purchase,Style: New,"I purchased this speaker because a friend of mine had the UE Boom and I was always impressed at how good it sounded. So I decided since I already had a smaller bluetooth speaker I would buy the MEGABOOM to get an even fuller sound.At first I was really happy. It sounded great had good connectivity, and even had a mic so I could use it as a speakerphone (which I would rarely do). I enjoyed that it was IP7X water and dust proof as this is a huge feature for something you are going to use at the beach or pool - or just need adult beverages.But then one night while using it the connectivity issues began. It would just disconnect whoever was using it. They could immediately reconnect, so I didn't think much of it. But then it happened to again and again. Not non-stop, but pretty consistently. At this point I decided it was time to contact UE/Logitech customer support as it was barely 2 months old.Having spent a career in IT I was well suited to do troubleshooting, so I made sure to go through what they would want me to do. Unpair and repair my iPhone, make sure the firmware was up to date, etc. I even included all of this information in the case I submitted. Two days later I received a reply from them asking me to do the things that I had already told them I had done. But they also left instruction to do a full reset on the speaker. I performed this as well. No changes - in fact some other features stopped working. Each time I updated the case it would take at least two days to reply, which I found aggravating.Finally I was issued an RMA, but of course their system requires that I send in the defective unit before they will send me out a replacement unit - which will likely take about 3-4 weeks before I have a replacement. And to make it even better I am going on a trip - one of the reasons I bought this speaker was to take it with me on this trip - but now I won't have it. I made a plea for them to send me one, and I would then return this one, as it is passable for the most part. But all I received in reply was a notice that the RMA would expire in 10 days. So I guess I'll be going on my trip sans speaker. This will make me consider other choices than UE or Logitech moving forward. Which is sad, as they had been my go to brand for PC accessories and the BOOM series sounds great.**** UPDATE 10/3/2016 ****So I went through the RMA process, got a new unit. Yay. The connectivity issues are solved, for the most part. The Bluetooth Smart functions, being able to remotely power on and off, do not function. But I have no interest in going through the sub-standard customer service again. Just going to live with some functions not working. Oh well. For what it's worth, I'd probably buy one again despite any of my negative comments.*** UPDATE 2/7/2017 ****This evening I discovered that the unit was not charging. I figured this time I would call rather than rely on a support email that took at least a day for a response. After about 15 minutes on hold I got to a representative. He guided me through a factory reset, which I know how to do, but was nervous about since I have heard this can damage your unit. But after it was said and done, it was charging again. I thought while I had him on the phone I would ask about the problems I had with the remotely powering the app on via the app. I will try and recreate the dialogue as best I can.Me: I cannot remotely power on or off the device?UE: Okay.Me: This doesn't make me happy, is there something we can do about this?UE: You can try to have another device to see if it will power on the speaker.Me: Let's just say that doesn't work, what is my next step?UE: It's an app issue, I can't help you.Me: But it's supposed to work, right?UE: Yeah.Me: Okay, Thanks for your help.*** Update 7/11/2017 ***The speaker hasn't worked right in a very long time. It now takes about 36 hours to charge. The battery is slow and burns out quick. I guess I am stuck at this point. Guess I'll be buying a replacement before too long. Probably not going to be a UE.",B00TXBOWVA,/gp/customer-reviews/R3J767ROOW9GSJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TXBOWVA,"June 2, 2016",9

This is the first tech toy I've bought ...,5,Verified Purchase,Style: New,"This thing is awesome.  This is the first tech toy I've bought in years (not counting phones). It has been an absolute delight and I find myself not using my stereo anymore.  When you first open the packaging you get excited because the plastic case this thing comes in is HUGE!, but your speaker won't be as big as it seems.  The sound can fill a room well though.  I take mine with me often when I teach Sunday school and use it for ambient sound during lectures and activities.  I also use it to play music during youth group days in the gym and it actually fills the gymnasium with good sound.  The bass is present bu its not booming. Basically, you never feel the powerful thumping in songs, but if you like your music for more than bass, you don't realy miss it, or even notice its not boomier.*** A side note - When I first got it I noticed there seems to be this glitch that happens from time to time where the sound will drop noticeably. An example might be while you're switching apps on your phone, or when you get a phone call during music and when it returns to the music it will be really low. I thought mine was broken but I found a simple solution was to hold the volume button on the actual speaker for a second and that would seem to fix it.  Also, sometimes just pausing and playing the song works.  I don't hesitate to return things when I don't like them, but for the UE Megaboom, I'm actually saving up to get another one so I can play them simultaneously.+ I like to use it on a small 10"" tripod, but the floor works great too and corners boost bass for small rooms.",B00TXBOWVA,/gp/customer-reviews/R2DWFDJ4T8EVQG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TXBOWVA,"March 7, 2016",One

But on charging the speakers were switching on and playing a very distorted sound with a lot of disturbance at high bass. I tried to contact Logitech support in India but they said they cannot give any support to devices bought in US. I also notified the US support and told them about the whole issue but they said they cannot do anything as my speakers are bought second hand from Amazon.I agree that I have bought the speakers from Outlet Digital (https://www.amazon.com/sp?_encoding=UTF8&asin=&isAmazonFulfilled=&isCBA=&marketplaceID=ATVPDKIKX0DER&orderID=&seller=A3IJCHMGVXATT2&tab=&vasStoreID=)  at Amazon.in and they were described like new. But the speakers come with a 2 year hardware warranty(The speakers were launched in Jan 2015) so they cannot be past their warranty time. Also at Logitech UE website they themselves sell used speakers. I am really frustrated and dejected by their indifferent behavior towards their flagship product.

Does NOT come with a usb cord, so have one of those kicking around. Seems odd since it DOES come with a wall adapter, but no cord :|Was already partially charged, but I still plugged it into the wall since I did not plan on using it for a while. The controls are minimal and it didn't take long to figure out where to plug it in. Upon plugging it in, a nice bright white led started pulsing to give me simple positive feedback that it was in fact already fully charged.One nice big button on the side to actually turn it on. Did that and then saw the bluetooth indicator also immediately begin to pulse, so I then flipped on the blue tooth on my phone and within 30 seconds it was paired with a nice clear drum beat sound. The first song I played came through with gorgeous clarity and full, deep tones. It far exceeded my expectations from such a small speaker.UPDATE: 205-09-08After updating the firmware, the unit no longer can be charged. They published a work around but it was too late and the unit now has zero charge, cannot be turned on and cannot be charged and is thus a $300 paper weight.

What a surprise when I received the UEMegaBoom speaker... Great quality, great sound with just the bass I was wanting. Easy setup via Bluetooth. I have iPhone 5s and they synced fast. The app offered from Apple has received bad reviews so as of now I haven't downloaded it. But you can download app from computer with windows7 and that's what I'm going to do to get the updates from UE. The sound from this small speaker fills a large great room,kitchen, and master bedroom....and sound quality is better to my ears hi,medium, to low,and lots of bass without distortion compared to the Bose Soundlink Mini. I purchased both to compare bass. Mega boom blows the Bose away! Sound is loud! And you don't need to fiddle with the EQ. The MegaBoom comes factory set and to me it's perfect and needs no tweaking. I listen to Madonna for workouts and Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett as well as Rod Stewart for easy listening. Clarity of the words in songs are crisp and clear.

The problem with this is you cannot charge and stand it vertical at the same time as the charging port (and aux port) are on the bottom of the speaker. I ended up getting around this by using an Oculus rift stand to prop it up higher (you can actually use any “tripod like” stand as it has the standard input port for using those. After the updates i was off to use this for the only thing i wanted to use this for, a speaker for my echo dot.For 2 days it worked and sounded great (hence the 2 stars and not 1) then the speaker would just cut out every other second while doing anything. Only way i could fix this was to disconnect bluetooth and reconnect which bought me another few days.By the way, side note...before this speaker I had a Bose soundlink hooked up to my echo dot for almost a year with no issues (its not the echo Dot)Anyway I eventually brought the speaker back after many different troubleshooting ideas i tried. Long story short the 2nd one did the exact same thing.Customer service was clueless of the issue and every response took about 2-3 days, I gave up and returned it for a whole different product all together.

This happened just one day after Best Buy's 15 day return policy.  Of course, right?  So I called ultimate ears and they did all of the stuff I already did and pronounced it defective and that they would send me a new one.  That was on 8/3.  Today is 8/16 and I have gotten nothing but the runaround from them . At first UE said they would send me a replacement and then I could send my old one back.  A week goes by and I hadn't received anything from them so I emailed them back and they said that something had changed and I must first mail the speaker back and then they would issue a replacement and in 48 hours I would receive a return label. That was a week ago and I have yet to receive a label.  I have emailed twice and heard nothing back.  This speaker is awesome when it works but once it doesn't, you're pretty much on your own.  I only got to use this speaker for one week before it went south.  So I spent $200 on something that doesn't work and the company won't remedy.  I knew I should have gone with BOSE.  You should too.Update: I just got off the phone with UE AGAIN, and they said that my case was pending and they would try to issue the return label.  So we will see what happens.

My only other problem is that it's sort of a pain to pair to a different device (or I have found that to be the case).

I love this thing.  It travels with me a lot.  My only complaint after two years is that the charge port is a little fiddly now and i have to jiggle the cord to keep it charging.  Not a big problem yet since it holds a charge for soooooo very long.  I get longer battery life that is listed when I keep the volume at about 50% (which since I live in an apartment is my typical volume level).  I can go for a day or two before I need to charge it.  Keep in mind I use this all day every day.  i even listen to music while I sleep.  I rarely watch TV because I prefer to listen to music.  I originally purchased the MegaBoom over the Boom due to the volume of this thing.  It has great sound either all the way up outside or down low for sleeping or use in hotel rooms.  However, I have found that it doesn't sound as good at top volume as it does at low volume.  I think I may have messed up the speakers when I kept the volume too high for too long but I should be able to do that correct?  Anyway, that doesn't detract from my 5 star rating because this thing does everything I want it to and it sounds great to me.  However, for a pool party with lots of people I have a different party speaker that sounds better at the highest volume for long periods of time.  The lowest volumes have great sound quality and I have absolutely nothing negative to say about that.

It is loud, and really excels outdoors. There is no distortion when played at full volume. If you are looking for the best sounding speaker to use inside your home only, then there are better sounding Bluetooth speakers such as: 1. Bose Mini  2. Bang and Olfusen Beolit 15,  3.

The Megaboom sounds best when placed in the corner of a room and on the floor due to the 360 degree sound output. Bottom line: The UE Megaboom is the best portable speaker and best sounding at loud volumes when placed outdoors. It is not the best sounding indoor speaker.

Other than that, this is PERFECT product.

But I'd invite anyone considering purchasing a UE product to first check their forums (under their umbrella company, Logitech), where dozens of users are absolutely exasperated about their products not functioning properly.Long story short, UE rolled out a new firmware update in October 2016. Previous updates had introduced cool features, and they were very convenient to install through my phone. So I was excited to download and see what they had in store for us this time. Unfortunately, this update introduced a latency issue, such that there was now a little delay before audio is actually played.This is fine for music, but it makes movie-watching unbearable. Like it's not even close to OK. It's just very out of sync and very distracting. I previously used this speaker for Skyping, transcribing audio, doing basic audio editing. None of that is really possibly with the delay we now have.Moreover, users' frustrations have been dominating their forums for weeks, and their support team has hardly even acknowledged the issue. I'd suggest savvy customers stick with a company that doesn't manage to remotely break their products.",B00TXBOWVA,/gp/customer-reviews/RGUQALGWO0N9O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TXBOWVA,"December 25, 2015",

Chris,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEV5NHLVIDDPZEC3VNNLHGJYHWFQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,"Best bluetooth speaker I have ever owned, amazing value.",5,,Style: New,"I have now owned and religiously used the UE Megaboom for nearly 2 months now. I have previously owned the Bose Soundlink, Soundlink mini, and a few other Bluetooth speakers and can easily say the UE Megaboom is by far my favorite!Pros:Superior sound quality, not only is the range fantastic, Logitech did a great job with speaker placement to ensure the speaker evenly distributes the sound in all directions. I notice little to no distortion when playing at maximum volume either.Battery life, my god they really outdid themselves here. The battery life in this speaker is FANTASTIC. I believe Logitech rates its lifespan on a single charge at 20 hours. I don't doubt that estimation for a second, I have not sat and let the speaker run for 20 hours however, in fact I have yet to even run the battery below 50%. I have gone nearly 3 weeks without plugging the speaker in and the battery was still over half charged. And during that 3 weeks I used the speaker nearly everyday during showers, at the gym, outside party's, at the hot tub and so forth. The only thing I really wish Logitech would have done was allow you to charge devices from the speakers battery, with a battery life as good as this speaker has I doubt I will ever run it completely dead. I would love to be able to plug in my phone however and get an extra charge out of it while at the park or pool while listening to music, I can assure you my phone's battery will die before the speakers does. The speaker charges exceptionally fast as well which is great!Waterproof: This is one of those specs that I am going to just believe is true and not go out and test it. The speaker carries an IP7 waterproof rating with it which is defined as, ""Ingress of water in harmful quantity shall not be possible when the enclosure is immersed in water under defined conditions of pressure and time (up to 1 m of submersion, 30 minutes)"" So in theory if you completely fumble this thing and it ends up at the bottom of the shallow end of the pool you don't have to panic. More likely than not though this won't happen to the majority of us. What the IP7 rating means to most of us is that if we are outside using the speaker and it starts to rain you have no need to fear. Also if you use the speaker in areas of high humidity such as your bathroom while showering you don't need to sweat. It may not be something that is needed, but it is definitely nice to have none the less.Updatable firmware: This is something I think a lot of people will take for granted when it should be extremely appreciated. Logitech has set up the speaker to be able to update its firmware via Bluetooth from your device using their app. What this means is that you can expect continuously improved performance and possibly great new features from your speaker in the future as Logitech pushes out updates for the speaker. Which leads me to my next pro.UE Boom App: The app available for you to download on your iOS or Android device is great and easy to use. It allows you to change the equalizer set up using either presets or completely customize it yourself. You can power on and off the speaker which is great, it means you don't have to get up and push the power button if the speaker isn't next to you (this does require you to enable ""Bluetooth smart"" on the speaker which states it has a small impact on battery life between charges, I can assure you that you won't notice any battery life difference). You can update the speaker firmware via Bluetooth from the app, view the battery level of the speaker, and set up an alarm as well. You can also ""Double Up""Double Up: Doubling up is an awesome feature as well, if you do happen to have the $600 it would require you to purchase 2 of these things you can set them up to play in stereo format which means you can listen to your music through both speakers at the same time which is awesome if you are outside at a large gathering or just really want to immerse yourself in the music. Now I assume if you have one Megaboom and one regular boom that you can still double up but don't quote me on that because it may not be true, I have not been able to test that theory.Bluetooth range: Good god this is great, the Megaboom has a rated Bluetooth range of 100ft give or take depending on the environment you are in (walls etc..) but I have yet to walk to far from this thing to hear it disconnect! I recently used the Megaboom at a picnic and had the speaker set up where we were playing volleyball and I had the phone in my pocket while playing, no connection issues whatsoever, I ran to the barbeque shortly after to grab some food which was what felt like a mile a way and could still hear my music loud and clear playing all the way across the park. It also means you don't have to leave your phone next to your speaker when you are just walking around your house. When I owned my Bose Soundlink Mini I hated that if I had music playing upstairs and ran downstairs to grab a bite real quick the speaker would disconnect half way down the stairs.Cons:Volume buttons: This is totally a personal thing, I am sure lots of people really like the big + and - buttons on the speaker but personally I would enjoy a cleaner/sharper look to it, some buttons that offered some real feedback would be great. The buttons may look huge on the speaker but it is only a small dot in the center of each that actually depresses and changes the volume.Unable to charge external devices: As I mentioned in my pros list under battery life, this thing has such a great battery life I am sure it has some milliamps to spare to power an external USB to allow me to charge my phone/iPod on the go. My phone will die 2 times over before this speakers battery runs dead.No ability to adjust speaker volume from app: UPDATE: Logitech has since updated the firmware and now you do have the ability to adjust the speaker volume from the app itself!Summary: This speaker is wonderful, personally I believe this speaker to be one of the best values on the market right now. If you are considering it against anything in the same price range, you can't go wrong with the Megaboom. Heck, if you are comparing this to the $200 speakers on the market such as The Pill or the Bose Soundlink I would highly recommend spending the extra money to get the Megaboom. And if you don't want to break that $200 mark, Logitech offers the UE BOOM which is a slightly smaller version of this speaker which I am sure is a great value as well. The only thing to consider if considering the smaller Boom is the volume may not be as loud, the battery life is shorter, it is not waterproof, and the Bluetooth connection range is rated as half as far as the Megaboom. So if you really want any of those features, step up and get the Megaboom, you won't be disappointed.",B00TXBOWVA,/gp/customer-reviews/RC7LVRYN816LQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TXBOWVA,"October 3, 2015",2

I had never even heard of these speakers.  Then one day my wife and I were in T-mobile store picking up the new Galaxy Note 5 for myself and the S6 edge for her.  She was telling me she liked the music that was playing and pointed to this little wireless speaker it was playing from and I was amazed.  Simply because I remember what bluetooth speakers sounded like when they first hit the market and ruled them out a long time ago, because I am the type of person that would rather have no music at all than crappy quality sound.The speaker the music was playing from was the smaller version of this one.  The UE boom 2.  It sounded great and so I asked one of the employees about the speaker.  His answer was ""yeah its a bluetooth speaker and its awsome"".  Usually it takes more than that to sell me on something but I was sold, because I had been wanted some good wireless speakers to play music on when I am just relaxing at home.  So I decided since the Boom 2 sound great, its bigger brother the Megaboom must sound great in a more powerful package.  So I ended up purchasing 2 of the megaboom speakers because while I was at the counter the guy told me that you could pair them and use them as stereo sound and if I bought one he would give me 10% off the second.  Now these speakers are 299 each so 10% isnt much but its something.I got them home and opened them up and just loved the way they both looked sitting on my sofa table.  Now these things do not require a rocket scientist to get them paired to whatever bluetooth device you are using to play music, but the fact that they do not come with any directions at all was a little crazy to me.  I mean they are 299 each.  The least they can do is give you some direction.  I got one paired to my phone and started playing music and I was so excited because just the one speaker sounded great and couldnt wait to hear them both together in stereo.  Upon trying to hook them both up I got a little frustrated because I couldn't get them both paired.  Again no directions.  After a while I finally went online and found out that you had to download the app to pair them.  That's fine but it would have been nice to have directions saying that.  That way something that took me a half hour to figure out would have only took a couple minutes to get working.  Needless to say I downloaded the app and got them both working in stereo and I love it.  So much that I just bit the bullet and ordered another one to go in my bedroom.  Now they are easily moved from one room to the other, but I don't want to have to move them.I will say that these are not the loudest speakers in the world.  They are definitely loud enough for me to hear from the back room in my house, but I know some reviewers were expecting for them to be rock concert loud which is ridiculous to me.  You are talking about a small wireless speaker that is ran off of a battery which plays continuously for 20 hours by the way.  You just are not going to get a ridiculous amount of power in a battery powered active speaker at this price point in this small of a speaker.  More power equals a bigger speaker because of the larger amp.  Which equals more money and to keep the same quality of sound with the larger amp it would cost even more.  More power also means a larger battery.  Are seeing where I am going here people?  Some people just do not think about those kind of details when they purchase an item.  Then they don't like it and blame it on the item itself.  When if they had put a little more thought into their purchase they would see there is no way at the price point they would get the power they were thinking.  Anyway as I said they gave this speaker as much power as possible, and focused more of their attention on sound quality itself, because power is easy.  Sound quality is what requires the attention.All in all. I love the speakers.  They are great.  They are build very solid.  They sound great and put out enough power to fill my house with beautiful sound.  In fact the only thing I would change about them is.  I wish there was a way to turn them on without have to physically touch them.  That would be nice, but also not a big deal.  I also would have given them a vertical flat face so that they could be laid down without rolling.",B00TXBOWVA,/gp/customer-reviews/R3NZUWOH7VBT94/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TXBOWVA,"January 29, 2016",3

Battery life seems to be pretty good considering I've only charged it once & have been using it on & off for the past week (playing music at 50%-75% volume). The app that you use with the Megaboom has some great features. You're able to turn the Megaboom off & on from the app. You can also adjust the equalizer to however you want it. The app allows you to see battery life & pair up another Megaboom or boom for a stereo sound. & don't forget, this thing is water proof! So no worries having this at the beach or by the pool, just make sure the rubber stoppers are firmly in place prior to exposing it to the outdoor elements. If you're on the fence on what bluetooth speaker to go with, give the Megaboom a shot. IMO, it's the best bluetooth speaker out right now for the price.",B00TXBOWVA,/gp/customer-reviews/RCN9SGF48HCYV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TXBOWVA,"July 20, 2015",4

We usually use a bigger speaker because we can listen to it down the field, but we couldn't use it this year; Luckily, I had this speaker in my car and once I started playing music it was very similar.This product is said to be shockproof and waterproof. I can agree with the waterproof because I've had water other things like beer spilled on it and it hasn't effected the speaker in any way.The design is my favorite part of the speaker. With the speaker all around the cylinder shape, the music shoots out in all directions so one side isn't sacrificed.  I like modern look and I also like the portability of the speaker as well. With a clip on the top of the speaker, you can't clip it on to anything and not have to worry about it falling. The Megaboom is small enough to not be a burden wherever you take it, but the quality of music is like it would come from a much bigger speaker. The overall technology that UE used to make this speaker is incredible.The coolest feature for the speaker is that you can connect one phone, using the UE app, to multiple speakers which results in a louder and funner party.Overall I loved this product, and I would recommend it to anyone.

The first time I turned it on and played a song, I knew I wasn’t going to keep it.  The sound just wasn’t there – it was pretty loud for it’s size, but it had no bass and wasn’t clear.  So I went to the store and bought a Bose Revolve.  In terms of sound there wasn’t much of a comparison, the Bose Revolve was MUCH better.  I had a few friends over and did a blind test where I would set the Boom and the Revolve next to each other and switch a song between the two.  We tried it with a variety of songs and the Bose won every time.I thought the Bose would be it, but a couple days later I saw the Megaboom on sale for the same price as the revolve.  Enter player three.  The sound comparison between the Megaboom and Revolve was a lot closer, but I would have to give the slight edge to the Revolve.  The bass was a little better and the vocals/instruments were slightly more distinct.  But it was close, I’m sure if I would have done another blind test, people would have picked the Megaboom on some songs.  The Bose was also about half the size of the megaboom (I’m comparing the regular revolve, the Revolve+ would probably blow the Megaboom away).  In the end though, I decided to keep the Megaboom because it beat the Bose in pretty much everything else.  Battery time is 20 hours vs 12, Bluetooth range is 100 ft vs 30, it’s waterproof vs splash resistant, charge time was 2 hours vs 4.  It was a really tough choice, but with price being equal, and my need of something portable that I could toss in a backpack and take to the beach without fear, I chose the more durable Megaboom.  If the Megaboom was regular price or I was looking for something that would be my primary speaker (in other words, I didn’t already have Sonos) I would definitely choose the Revolve or Revolve+.

The pairing with my Samsung Note 3 and my wife's Galaxy 5 was simple. Immediately upon installing the app, it performed a firmware update for the speaker. There haven't been any since that first one.Given the relatively expensive nature of this speaker, I'd like to get right to the sound. This is the best wireless speaker that I've heard in this price range. I had my friend bring over his Bose Mini wireless speaker for comparison. This speaker fills the room just as well as the Bose Mini, and seems to have better range. The highs are definitely crisper and the lows are sufficient enough for a speaker of its size.  I also compared it to my recently purchased Amazon Echo. There's no comparison, the Megaboom blows the Echo away in terms of sound and loudness.  I also put it up against the Soundkick speaker that I purchased a year ago. Sound wise there's no comparison. The Megaboom blew it away as well- as it should for over three times the price.I found the 360 degree of sound claim to be very interesting and placed the speaker on my outside table so I could walk around it and evaluate the sound in an open space. When I walked around this speaker outside I noticed that the left and right channels are absolutely directional in nature. To figure this out I simply put on Van Halen 1 and Van Halen 2. If you know these albums, you know that Eddie's guitar was recorded in the left channel. If you place this speaker with the volume controls at the BACK, you will find that the left side of the speaker represents the left channel. I found this little tidbit to be quite interesting given how the speaker is constructed and based on the 360 degree of sound claims on the website.Overall, the speaker is very well constructed. It's got a soft fabric feel to it and claims to be weatherproof. I personally would not try dropping a $300 speaker in the pool, so I'll just accept their claims and keep it safely away from such dangers. The website claims it will still function after getting dunked.It's light enough to tote around without any problem. It charges via a simple USB cable that we have dozens of. It doesn't require a proprietary wall wart of an adapter thankfully! (Hear THAT Amazon Echo??)  It would be nice is there was some sort of retractable handle for carrying, but that's a minor gripe.There's nothing I can complain about when it comes to the UE Megaboom, except perhaps its price of $300. Then again, it sounded better than the Bose Mini. So I suppose you get what you pay for in terms of quality. It's a lot of money for a portable speaker. But it's got a two year warranty and should last quite a long time being that the battery is replaceable (at what price I do not know.)",B00TXBOWVA,/gp/customer-reviews/R3ASILMAV0D5J3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TXBOWVA,"May 14, 2015",

ThisIsNot,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFYOAXM3QOH2445PHUSUFJVXE7AA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,"Sounds great, sturdy, good battery life",5,,Style: New,"I recently decided to upgrade my current Bluetooth speaker (the original UE Boom) to something a bit bigger.  I wanted a unit that could last just as long on a charge (at least 15 hours), produce more volume, and at least be able to replicate the same sound quality of the UE Boom.  I originally went with the Beats Pill XL as I really liked the overpowering bass but that was recalled.  Now having received my money refund, I went back on the market.This time, however, there was the Megaboom.  I purchased the Megaboom along with the SoundLink III to test both speakers at my home in various listening conditions.  These include a small bathroom (10'X15'), sitting on my desk (which is in my living room), on my patio deck (13'X13'), and out in the field with all sorts of loud equipment running.  My music source was my Samsung Galaxy Note Edge with music all downloaded from Google Music All Access (320kbps mp3 files).  I listened to the Megaboom and SoundLink III (which I will now call MB and SLIII, respectively) in those environments using songs in the genres of metal (everything from Metallica to Korn, Cannibal Corpse, Rob Zombie The Black Dahlia Murder, Slayer), classic metal (Black Sabbath, Judas Priest, Iron Maiden), classic rock (AC/DC), some hip-hop/rap (mainly Eminem and old Ice Cube), and then dubstep/techno (Nero, Skrillex).Overall, I found the MB to be more pleasing.  It was able to produce a louder volume while retaining its clarity, more highs, and more lows without being overbearing.  The only time the SLIII was able to produce more lows was when its back was up about 1-2"" from a solid wall.  I only use the speaker like that when its on my desk and when its in the bathroom.  Otherwise I'm not putting my speakers up near a wall.  The MB was also more balanced with one aspect not taking over another while the SLIII was definitely more bass-heavy with muffled highs.  I think the SLIII is definitely more stylish that the MB but, at the same time, it is also more fragile.The MB is full on waterproof for up to 30 minutes at a depth of 1 meter (3.28 ft), it also floats for quite a bit of time before filling up with water.  That means you can put it right next to the pool and, if it accidentally falls in, you have plenty of time (a good 5-10 minutes) to get it out of the pool before it sinks.  It also means that you can take the MB in the shower with you, it's also dust/dirt resistant so you can take it to the beach as well or out camping.  The SLIII requires the purchase of a protective case if you don't want to scratch the aluminum (which is an additional $35).  There's also the issue of power.  The MB is rated for 20 hours of playback but that seems to be the number if you play at maximum volume.  I have read many reviews that put the MB's battery life at 25 hours on medium volume and my numbers (I've drained and charged it twice) agree with that.  The SLIII is rated for 14 hours of playback and that's about accurate, it's a little less when playing at a higher volume.  The MB comes with an AC adapter that has a standard USB port and it charges via micro USB.  You could always charge it with a smartphone charger (even an iPhone/iPad charger) if you had to.  It wouldn't be as fast as the included AC adapter but it would still work.  The SLIII only charges with Bose's proprietary AC adapter.Lastly, there's the issue with features.  The SLIII has basic playback and volume controls on the top of it along with a standard 3.5mm input, that's it.  The micro USB port on the back of the SLIII is for firmware upgrades and I didn't receive one while I had the unit.  The MB only has volume controls on the unit (along with power and Bluetooth buttons) but you can turn the speaker on and off, remotely, using the MB app from your smartphone or tablet (Android and iOS only).  You can also change the EQ of the MB using the app, upgrade the firmware, and the best feature: double-up.  This lets you pair the MB with another MB to get proper stereo sound or dual-mono sound.  You can also pair up with a smaller UE Boom with the same setup (stereo or dual-mono).  It's a great feature and I wish more speakers would do it but UE and Beats seem to be about the only ones supporting it.The price of the MB may seem a little high but you really are getting a great Bluetooth speakers that's still extremely portable.  The original Boom was about the size of a can of Monster/Rockstar energy drink and the MB is about as big as my 24 oz Thermos water bottle (it's a little shorter and has a slightly larger diameter).  It weighs 339 grams (almost 3/4 of a lb) more than the UE Boom, equating to an extra 63% but it's still very portable.  You can hook a carabiner clip to it and take it everywhere.  You can also hook a small camera tripod up to it if you want to wrap it around a tree limb or keep it up off a puddle of water or out of the sand (neither of which would hurt it).  The bass is lacking a bit compared with the SLIII but the highs are more prominent and the sound is overall more balanced.  The MB is sturdier, lasts longer on a single charge, and has a lot more features.I highly recommend this over the SLIII and definitely the Big Jambox (which I had a couple of years ago before the Beats Pill XL).  People who had to send their Pill XL units back to Apple for a recall would be wise to pick one of these up instead.  It's a great solution.",B00TXBOWVA,/gp/customer-reviews/RJMWMOBJSB0GJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TXBOWVA,"July 6, 2015",14

Sound quality is excellent - most 360-degree speakers like this leave something to be desired when it comes to audio quality, but the Megaboom is one of the best I have tested.  It's also worth noting that the speaker can go very loud - certainly far louder than I would ever need it to be.I find the insane battery life and the extended wireless range are much better than the average speaker on the market; so if you care about those features (which are not necessary, but are certainly more convenient) then it may be worth spending the money on this.The ""waterproofing"" feature is a nice bonus; it allows you to use the speaker outside or at a party without having to worry about it getting a little wet.  I would not go submerging this in the water though (although UE's product info states that it can be submerged for 30 minutes - I'm not going to find out!).",B00TXBOWVA,/gp/customer-reviews/R2AQDRCUOO96VG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TXBOWVA,"May 13, 2015",

I went for the megaboom because I never wanted to have to say ""I wish this speaker was louder"" as you often have to do with other speakers.

I have left this speaker outside unattended for days and it has no issues.  The battery life is phenomenal and the speaker doesn't lose charge if it isn't used for a while.

AMZ,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFFBOGBNHEACMLOI4XOLX4YBO7JA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,"If you are caught between buying the JBL Xtreme and the UE Megaboom, this review is for you!",5,,Style: New,"I purchased a UE Megaboom, not from amazon, but from best buy because i'm super impatient.Initially i was caught between buying the JBL Xtreme and the UE Megaboom because they were both rugged speakers designed for the outdoors. Primary usage for this speaker would be around bodies of water so it needed to have some form of water resistance. In this review im going to use the Harman Kardon Onyx as a benchmark for some aspects of comparison.SOUND QUALITY:The UE Megaboom has a very balanced sound, it is not super bass heavy like the JBL Xtreme, but it can definitely hold its own. One thing i should mention is that the JBL Xtreme is only water RESISTANT, it is not waterproof and submersable like the UE Megaboom. This aspect will definitely affect sound quality because as we know, bass is created by air movement. When you have a watertight space, it makes releasing air difficult. The Megaboom has 4 passive radiators to remedy this issue. The JBL Xtreme only requires 2 because it is only water resistant and is designed with the radiators on the end of the device. It is impossible to get a waterproof speaker to sound like, say, a Harman Kardon Onyx because the Onyx cant even go near moisture, it has a radiator and absolutely no water protection so it can move the most air and create the most bass tones. That being said, the UE Megaboom has a very solid sound that can keep up well with many different styles of music.I put the UE Megaboom through a series of tests with different styles of music from the Amazon Music streaming service, here are my findingsHip-Hop: Hold On, Were Going Home - DrakeThis song's tight, punchy bass comes through super bright on the UE Megaboom. Vocals are also clean and bright. it struggles slightly with the deep sub-bass tones, but that is to be expected from two 2 inch drivers. The most important aspects of the song come through.Pop: Get Lucky - Daft PunkThis is a song i have heard on a multitude of different speakers so i would say that i know how this song should sound. On the UE Megaboom, this song's rich, warm tone comes through beautifully! The speaker has no problem clearly differentiating the guitar from the bass guitar. Pharrell's vocal tone also comes through nicely also. When the robot's start to sing towards the end, the treble tones are incredible and come through loud and clear, but not enough to drown out the rest of the tones.Classic Rock: Panama - Van HalenRock music is really where the UE Megaboom shines. This song sounds good on just about any speaker, but on the UE megaboom, it makes it sound like youre hearing them live. The guitars come through very nicely and compliments the bass tones from the drum kit. Guitar solos come through incredibly since they consist of treble tones, which the Megaboom is able to replicate clearly.Reggae: One Love - Bob MarleyReggae music is not a bad option for this speaker. On a remastered version of Bob Marley's One Love, each instrument comes through the clearest of all the genres i have played so far. It is super bright and clear, that is all i can say. Buy one and listen for yourself.EDM: Be Right There - Diplo & Sleepy TomEDM is a genre that is rather hit or miss on the UE Megaboom. Some songs can sound good and some not so much. Be Right There by Diplo and Sleepy Tom is a great example of EDM that sounds fantastic on the Megaboom. Bass tones come through with a nice rumble. Between bass and the majority of the treble tones, the Megaboom has no issues differentiating them. By the time the first drop comes around, the Megaboom handles the bassline fairly well. We do not get very much of the super deep sub-bass, but we get the bass tones that matter.Country: Brad Paisley - WaterIt is at this point that i am starting to see a pattern between the UE Megaboom's clear tones and organic instruments, and Brad Paisley's Water is no exception. Brad's vocals come through very strong and the guitar tones benefit as they are complimentary. Like in the rock genre, guitar solos come through very clear and clean.VOLUME:I usually listened to the Megaboom at around 40-50% volume. Playing an hour of music at 75% volume got me a nice note from my neighbors on my door (I live in a college dorm with thin walls). So trust me when i say, volume is not an issue with the Megaboom, its got a ton of oomph behind it!Now lets compare features and weigh out the Pros and Cons.BATTERY LIFE:The JBL Xtreme only gets a 15 hour battery life while the Megaboom keeps the party going for an additional 5 hours.You are able to charge your phone on the JBL Xtreme while you cant on the megaboom, but with the money you save buying the Megaboom, you can buy yourself one of those power banks to charge your phone from. One other advantage is that if you have a Power Bank, you can charge the Megaboom off of that since it charges via USB instead of a proprietary plug that reminds me alot of the one that came with my Harman Kardon Onyx.EASE OF USE:The Megaboom and the JBL Xtreme rival in their ease of use. Both have a complimentary app and they both have some form of social mode. They both are able to pair a second speaker to create stereo sound. Do i have the budget for that? Heck no, but it would sure be cool to see them work in tandem! Once you get the Megaboom charged (It requires at least 6 hours for the initial charge, the charging light will stop flashing when it is fully charged), turn it on, and you can get it paired to your device within 30 seconds initially. Once its paired to a device it will pair almost instantly once turned on.SIZE:The UE Megaboom is about the size of a 40oz HydroFlask. It is skinnier by about 1/4 inch which makes toting it considerably easier. Its weight is about half of the JBL Xtreme which also makes portability a win for the Megaboom. The JBL Xtreme is heavy, weighing in at almost 5 pounds. JBL knows its heavy too because it comes with a shoulder strap. The Megaboom can be easily tossed into a backpack while the Xtreme requires you to carry it off body which could limit the places you could take it.CARE:Both the JBL Xtreme and the UE Megaboom can be cleaned under a running faucet. However, i believe the UE Megaboom can handle water better since it is IPX7 waterproof and can be submerged for up to 30 minutes in 3 feet of water. I would honestly be wary about a device that can be cleaned under a faucet, but you cant submerge it (JBL, im looking at you). Both the JBL and the UE have the same woven skin over the speaker which gives it a really unique look. Ive heard that the fabric is plasma coated which gives it its water resistance.SUPPORT:The UE Megaboom has a 2 year warranty and a battery replacement service (yes, the battery is replaceable!). For 49 bucks you send your Megaboom to Logitech and they replace your battery. The JBL Xtreme is a sealed unit and the battery is not replaceable, or it is and they dont advertise it like Logitech does, its kind of a mystery.CONCLUSION:While yes, the JBL Xtreme may sound better, it has some limiting factors that affects intended usage. When i think ""rugged speaker"", i want to be able to take it everywhere without worrying about damage. Since the UE Megaboom is not only waterproof but also shockproof, i believe that it is a superior rugged speaker in terms of the amount of abuse it could be able to handle. The only speaker that may surpass it in ruggedness is the Braven BRV-PRO which is designed to go wherever a go-pro can go because of its mount but you are sacrificing sound quality at an even greater level for ruggedness. The UE megaboom is a great compromise between ruggedness and sound quality and i would recommend it to anyone heading out on adventures and wants a great sounding speaker to take with them!",B00TXBOWVA,/gp/customer-reviews/R25GEPJXSZDB19/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TXBOWVA,"March 28, 2016",3

After some searching and testing, I found that I needed to reset the device to factory settings (holding down the '-' volume and the power button for 10 seconds); this evidently is necessary since the device can only remember 8 bluetooth devices total, and then won't pair with any new device.  However, after doing this, I've needed to reset my UE Megaboom after each use...if I want to use it with my phone, I do that, but then if I want to pair it to my laptop to watch a movie, now I need to reset the UE Megaboom to pair it to my laptop.

I found the sound to be quite loud and space-filling, and the effective radius is nearly 360 degrees. The form factor makes it easy to carry around, too.Pros:1) Loud/powerful. Definitely has good ability to fill a large open space with sound2) Water resistant. Have to have that for beach or pool gatherings3) Good Bluetooth range. I had no problems from 50 to 75 feet away, which should cover most party crowds4) Sound. Overall, it is better than other such speakers and in a party situation will not be an issue. Music fills the air evenly all around, but instruments are muted a bit directly behind it. See Cons for further comments5) The app is a must. You need it to connect 2 MegaBooms and has an equalizer that you most likely will want to use6) Can be used as an alarm7) High quality, durable build quality and feel8) Software updates happen and may add future functionality9) Linking 2 can be used as stereo or 2 monos9) Bonus: The lime green USB power adapter and flat wire cord has fast charging capabilities. If you bought a new Samsung S6, it will work with thatCons:1) Volume Buttons. You will get used to them, but the tactile feedback is weak. People unfamiliar with the product will most likely be stumped how to change volume. However, the app can be used for volume, as well2) Sound quality. On one hand, for this type of speaker, it is far above average. Perhaps one of the best. On the other hand, it is not going to pump out audiophile quality sound. Not even close. I have used other Bluetooth speakers, including a high end Bose, and they all seem to have something missing. It seems like you have to sacrifice something in order to push the base out and turn up the highs. There is a hollowness to the sound. However, the app (or you could also use any similar app you like) comes with preset sound profiles or you can customize it on your own with the equalizer, so that helps. Still, and I can't emphasize this enough, in an outdoor party situation, with a lot of people talking, in the open air, this speaker will not disappoint. It will deliver the sound at a volume needed and fill up a large space, and no one is probably going to nit pick at the details of the audio quality. This thing can rock!I am not sure about the battery life, but I've used a bit with no issues. And, since it has a fast charger, that's helps get it back up to speed sooner.I think if you are a purveyor of large outdoor gatherings, especially at a beach, this is a device worth looking into.

The Megaboom has two things going for it: long battery life, and durable (waterproof) construction. The sound quality is very mediocre, with harsh highs and hollow-sounding, boomy bass (not tight, punchy bass). I realize that you need to have realistic expectations with a bluetooth speaker, but the sound quality of the Megaboom is just not worth the premium price. If it was 100 bucks, it would be a decent deal, but it's just not worth the $270 price tag. My iLoud was $50 bucks cheaper, and it sounds so much better than the Megaboom, that it's not even a contest (much louder, too). There is an obvious reason for this: the iLoud uses two larger drivers, and two actual tweeters, with separate amps. You will never get full range of sound from a speaker by trying to get all the frequencies from two 2"" drivers (as the Megaboom does); it would defy the laws of physics. You're probably wondering, ""if you already knew that, why did you buy the Megaboom?"". Well, that's a good question. I bought the Megaboom because I wanted a waterproof speaker for outdoor stuff like fishing and kayaking, even though I knew that it wouldn't sound as good as some of it's competitors.If you really need a waterproof bluetooth portable speaker, there just aren't a lot of options, so the Megaboom might still be the best one. But if you want better sound and/or higher volume, get the iLoud. If you want better sound at low volumes, get the Sony SRS-X7 or the Soundlink 3. The iLoud needs some volume to sound really good, where the DSP of the X7 and SL3 gives them fuller sound at lower volumes. I also had a Beats Pill XL that I returned. It sounded better than the Megaboom, but not as good as the other 3 that I mentioned, and it had short range for the Bluetooth.",B00TXBOWVA,/gp/customer-reviews/RVLN4WV1NQY8H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TXBOWVA,"August 6, 2015",

You are going to be paying a lot for this item.  Do you get what you pay for?  I'm not sure.  You get a lot, yes, but it is not perfect, nor is it to everyone's tastes.When they say party speaker, they mean it.  It can be VERY loud, as loud as your typical portable boombox (but obviously more compact and with bluetooth).  It is also EXTREMELY bassy, to the point where for some folks and some types of music, it will definitely be too bassy.  With alternative rock, for instance, the bass guitar overpowers everything.  This can't be changed unless you have the ability to download the accompanying app (iOS or Android) which lets you fiddle with the EQ somewhat.  It will still be really bassy, though, which means bassy voices go above others in podcasts, and bass guitar overpowers everything.  EQ helps.  I can understand their wanting to minimize the amount of buttons on the actual unit, thus leaving it to the app, and most folks who buy/use this will probably be able to get and use the app as well.  Not to mention it is a party speaker, and for dance music and stuff, people will be really impressed with the bass/volume output.Battery life is pretty fantastic.The carrying case it comes with would have been a great idea and really neat, but it does not latch.  It's about worthless.  For $300, a carrying case that actually works would have been nice.So, while this is pretty awesome, I am taking a star off because of the carrying case, the default sound balance, and the high price.  Maybe that is a little unfair of me.  I would go with 4 1/2 stars if I could.  I don't know what this kind of product costs to make or what the profit margin is either, which would help me with the score.  If they are making a huge profit on these, I would be a little less forgiving.  On the other hand, if these are expensive to make...Oddly enough, this unit is also waterproof.  Does this mean it can sit in the pool with you?  Not sure.  Go in the shower?  Maybe.  Go to the beach?  I don't know.  With a $300 speaker, who is going to want to test this?  I'd be scared of it getting ruined.  Could be a great feature if properly explained.Speaking of explanation, there are no instructions really.  It is quite easy to pair, but instructions explaining features (like being waterproof and to what extent and how to download/use the apps--make sure you get the correct app! there's more than one!) are missing.All things considered, going with 4 stars for a really impressive, great sounding speaker with great battery life, ridiculously bassy sound (seriously), great volume, good quality, possibly waterproof--with a few bells and whistles that aren't really up to what I'd expect (having to use the app for EQ, useless carrying case, lack of instructions).",B00TXBOWVA,/gp/customer-reviews/R3QWNMAJEBPEJP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TXBOWVA,"April 14, 2015",4

The best small all-in-one speaker I have heard.,5,,Style: New,"This is a truly amazing portable speaker.  From opening the hard shell presentation case to listening to music, the UE Megaboom is a delight.In the reusable case, there is the speaker, a USB charging block and - in an easily missed separate compartment on the bottom - a USB cable.  What is lacking are any instructions.  Fortunately pairing was so easy with my Galax S5 none were needed.  The volume is controlled by the phone volume or the big plus/minus icons seen on the front of the speaker.For the most functionality, there is a phone app that provides several useful features.  With it you can adjust sound quality via an EQ interface, pair Megaboom speakers, set an alarm and update the speaker firmware.  My only trouble with using the speaker came with the app install.  Or should I say the wrong app install.  I found out the hard way that there is a UE Boom app and a UE Megaboom app.  Google play pulled up the more seasoned UE Boom app first with my search so I installed it.  It did not work.  Tech support was very nice in working with me to solve the issue (with no wait time I might add) and after installing the correct app everything worked just as it should.Then there is the sound.  Wow.  Just wow.  The range and quality are impressive.  The bass is outstanding.  The room filling capability amazing.  Compared to my other portable Bluetooth speakers -  a Jabra SoulMate, a larger Altec Lancing, an Edifier – well actually there is no comparison.  The Megaboom is the best sounding speaker of its size and portability I have yet to hear.  In addition it is waterproof, light, has great Bluetooth range and has upgragable firmware.  The only thing I can think of that could improve is the USB connection.  No Mini USB cord I own would fit it.  Only the one that came with it would fit because the opening on the speaker bottom is oddly shaped and small.",B00TXBOWVA,/gp/customer-reviews/R2WG1VBBL533DW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TXBOWVA,"April 8, 2015",13

Pairing with several devices all worked well (iPhone, iPad, Kindle Fire and even a Blackberry Q10). The Bluetooth and power controls are discreetly placed at the bottom of the speaker and volume controls are represented by a large ""+"" and ""-"" on the side. There is a small hook on the top if you want to hang it rather than set it on a tabletop.As for the sound, it really is amazing - rich and full - and the Bluetooth range easily hit the 100' mark (outside in an open, flat yard).A separate travel case is available but the one that this comes in should be more than enough for most people - it is sturdy and offers good protection for the speaker.I'm no audiophile and the last person you would expect to be touting a $300 speaker but it is worth every penny.",B00TXBOWVA,/gp/customer-reviews/RDVO1P1QIGKHQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TXBOWVA,"April 12, 2015",7

No issues at all with syncing to iPhone, effortless set up.  Speaker could get pretty loud, more than enough for a get together or backyard BBQ.  Sound was good for a portable BT speaker, but NOT worth the price.  I have honestly heard BT speakers that are comparable or better for half the price.  The EQ, is a joke.  The sound field was a lot better than one directional speakers, but not 360 as advertised.  I set it up on the center of my patio table and walked around a few times....there were definitely spots that were dull.  The battery life was great, and the protection from elements was a plus.Second impression:  I have now owned the unit for nearly 7 weeks, and it has progressively gotten more disappointing as time went on.  My battery life continued to get shorter and shorter each time I used it.  I would fully charge it and set it aside for a day or so and when powered on for use, the battery would be half gone?  Odd considering it was not used, on, or messed with and the battery kept draining.  Even if I had paid HALF of what I paid for this that performance is UNACCEPTABLE!

Compared to the best I have heard. Blue tooth or wired powered monitors, this UE Megaboom puts on a good show.Big pluses.Dynamics. It has some guts. If you get 2 of them and run the free app for IOS, and Android.  You get Stereo configuration, Equalization, discrete mono assignment, and much more. 300.00 is allot of money for a portable speaker. My reference speakers in the affordable wired, and Bluetooth speakers are Emotiva Audio's Airmotiv 4s, and Stealth 3B speakers. See www.Emotiva.com for more.The UE boom like I said is dynamic. Will project well. Will keep on going till the onset of amplifier compression. Then it gets congested, and out of sorts. But compared to others, it does pretty well. Tonality is quite good, but a bit woolly in the midrange for its own good. Highs a bit soft too. Usable bass is quite good, well defined, and controlled. Noticeable drop off below 200Hz but even still a good showing.Detail is a bit lacking favoring the big picture more than any close listening may reward. Contrast to the Emotiva Stealth 3B speakers which have better detail, and resolution. Also since they are less than 300.00 a pair, a bargain too. They are a more at your desk kind of speaker solution. The UE Megaboom goes everywhere. It can get wet, and still work. Stains just wipe off too! The hook on the bottom makes hanging it in Your patio easy.  You pick the colors you like. The black strikes me fine.Battery life is quite good. Easily a full day of enjoyment on a full charge via a USB micro connection with the provided wall charger wart. A cheap switcher power supply type.Overall this is a much better speaker than the UE boom in ultimate terms. Richer and fuller flavor. Missed are few like the price. 300 dollars for some is not going to work for a speaker like this. A shame really, because for what you get, it is good value for the on the go listener, maybe a desk type if you get 2 of them for stereo. That is 600 dollars! For that money you could buy powered monitors by Emotiva audio that will sound better, cost less, and will hook up to your phone no problem. Only thing, the UE Megaboom can go places the Emotiva Airmotiv can't.

(with a couple less awesome observations),5,,Style: New,"While I personally do love this speaker, I must address some of the features and issues that I and my family experienced.The Ease of use with iPhones and Windows phones cannot be over stated.  This thing just turns on, the phone sees it and (BAM!) you are connected and jamming to awesome tunes.  However, none of our Android devices could even see this speaker, let alone connect to it.  Direct phono-cable connection took care of that though.The sound quality and presence are truly quite amazing for such a portable system (I can pick out individual back up singers), the sound fills the room.  That is, when you are listening to 60's, 70's, 80's, 90's music.  Instrumental, Jazz, piano and harpsichord music also sound lovely from this speaker.However, as soon as you jump into the 21st century you find that some of the layers are lost when listening to extremely complex music (Evanescence for example), especially complex Techno.  Most people don't have sound systems good enough to know what they are missing, and perhaps it isn't fair to compare this sub-$299 waterproof ultra-portable speaker to our $550 Boston Acoustic home theater / stereo system or my wife's $2,000 Bose sound system (in her Jaguar).  Still, I wan't people to understand what they are getting so they are happy with their purchase.(Update: To address the comment below about compressed audio files I should point out that I tested all mentioned systems using exactly the same mp3 64bit compressed audio sources.  The differences were obvious and not caused by variations of source encoding.)This is, by far, the best sounding and most earth shattering truly portable speaker system that I have ever encountered.  Add to that, it's water proof!  This is an amazing option for those on the go.  That it works as speaker/microphone for your phone is a seriously cool added bonus.  Given how loud I was able to get the caller on the other side of the line to sound in my house (way too loud), I contend that you could use this as a speaker for a presentation in a small auditorium for someone who is not physically able to attend.  Even at that extreme volume the audio was clear and crisp.One complaint that has absolutely nothing to do with this speakers functions or quality is the marketing angle.  The company seems to be attempting to appeal to everyone and in so doing is really losing many.  Fine, let's take it up to 11 (Dang I'm old, I know that reference from when it was in theaters, before there were DVD's and Blu-ray), but given the state of the world today it is simply not acceptable nor reasonable to market in a way that promotes riots and mayhem.  That is just poorly thought out and, in all honesty, probably actionable.Finally, the packaging and presentation:  This is another hit for the MegaBoom.  The packaging is very high end and the presentation says quality all the way.  That one could save and use the quality packaging for transport and travel is an awesome added bonus that I didn't see coming.Another fine bonus is the included instruction for how to be environmentally responsible and dispose of the battery when you are, eventually, done with this product.  That is a nice bonus that most products miss the mark on.Highly Recommended!!!",B00TXBOWVA,/gp/customer-reviews/R356QP3OKW1HWY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TXBOWVA,"April 7, 2015",2

The term ""mega"" is really pushing it a bit far I guess, as the performance of this speaker is below average if just sound quality alone is considered especially looking at the asked price. The sound is extremely colored with lots of honky upper bass, but no depth, and treble is non existent, especially if not one of the both drivers is not facing you directly, this makes the 360° claim a bit absurd, as most of the time you will have to get along with a rather dull sound.But there was always lots of hype around UE products, and the Megaboom seems to continue with this fashion.Where the Megaboom really shines is ruggedness and maybe features, you can pair 2 for wireless stereo, you have can turn it off/on remotely through the app and other nice stuff, but I wouldn't choose it for listening to music.If you want it really loud, check out the Riva Turbo X, which outclasses the Megaboom with a much more serious sound, better bass response and a more Hifi-like tuning while being louder at the same time. If you want a more refined sound at lower levels with much better stereo imaging that you can put inside your pocket, check out the Denon Envaya Mini, which makes the Megaboom sound really funny although it won't play near as loud as the Megaboom, this is rather a speaker to scream out loud without finesse. If you want to go diving with your speaker, or play american football with it, the Megaboom should do the trick, but anyone serious about music and quality of sound will make a big circle around the Megaboom and spend the 300 bucks somewhere else.",B00TXBOWVA,/gp/customer-reviews/R29SXXP9BQ2I2N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TXBOWVA,"April 13, 2015",17

Scott Albertine,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEEI6B7TLEJD6N43Y4BZD65AKI5Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,The best speaker on the planet.,5,Verified Purchase,Style: New,"Oh my.  This thing.  Wow.  I'd do a page-long rant about how this is the greatest speaker ever, but that'd be boring, so I'll trim it down to a list of things the marketing info doesn't already tell you:They are not kidding about the waterproofness.  Take a shower with it, take a 3 hour bike ride through pouring rain, drop it in your bathtub, no problem. THAT SAID, IT IS NOT SALT-WATER PROOF.  Their marketing material literally says ""take it to the beach"", which I did, but it was a salt-water beach, and after that it stopped working.  This review is for the second one I bought after the first one stopped working, because frankly it's such a good speaker that it's worth it.They are not kidding about the shock-proofing.  This thing has survived 4 foot drops straight onto concrete, not a scratch.They are not kidding about the ""Mega"" part of the sound.  It's louder than a city bus, with punchy bass and no rattling or distortion, even at max volume.They ARE kidding about the 20 hour battery life.  I get 6 solid hours at max volume, continuous play over bluetooth.  Your mileage may vary but I've found it to be very consistent.They are only half kidding about the ""pair it to a second speaker"".  It works as advertised, but it drops the range on both speakers to hilariously short, I'd say a maximum of about 15 feet, before the music starts cutting in and out randomly.  That said, the timing is perfect, there's absolutely no lag between the two speakers.The multi-host thing works... decently well.  My macbook hogs it for some reason so that if I turn on the speaker while the laptop is on, it never connects to my phone.  That said, it'll switch off between my phone and my friend's phone no problem, no buttons required, one of us stops playing music and the other starts, within 10 seconds it'll cut over.The D-ring clip is great, but I recommend using blue Loctite on the threads so it won't unscrew itself.",B00TXBOWVA,/gp/customer-reviews/R354W2EM2XRAY5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TXBOWVA,"August 17, 2015",3

Eagle Vision,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGOI2GR7P5UX42F3RFUKYCQE7SAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,Powerful speakers with a great battery life in a portable size.,5,Verified Purchase,Style: New,"What comes in the box?AC AdapterMicro USB cableSpeakerThe packaging is reusable as a carrying or storage box.The UE Megaboom by Logitech is a very powerful speaker system.  I have purchased this speaker based upon reading reviews prior to purchasing.  The battery life is incredible, and it exceeds the battery life of anything in its class.  It is simple to operate and pair with your Bluetooth enabled device.  The large volume buttons are easy to handle and adjust, especially with wet hands.The construction is solid and it is waterproof.  The access ports for the input jack and the Micro USB cable are sealed.  At the bottom, there is a hook that makes for a good way to hang the speakers out of your way.  It is about as tall as my Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 is tall.  The size is similar to an Arizona Tea or 40 ounce beer can.  This has some serious girth and weight so it is stable for outdoor use in wind.The sound quality is incredible.  It has a covers bass, midrange and treble equally well.  The bass is more vibrant than average speakers.  I plan to acquire a second speaker  to get more of a stereo effect outdoors.  However, the sound coming from this single speaker is nothing short of immersive in an enclosed room.  Placing it close to a wall, allows the sound to reflect back towards you giving a unique effect, also.There is an app available through the Apple App store but I do not see an advantage unless I have a pair of these speakers.  So I just ordered a second speaker for the purpose of a stereo effect.  Once I get my second speaker, I will update the review.For its size, it is the best in its class for similar sized speakers.  It is very powerful, and there is no distortion even with the maximum volume level for any genre of music.",B00TXBOWVA,/gp/customer-reviews/RIW8T4435LGEL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TXBOWVA,"November 17, 2015",One
