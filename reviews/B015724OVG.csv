I have been using Norton for a few years, and I am reasonably satisfied with the product, but I have not compared it with competing products lately.  Thirty days before the 1-year license expires, Norton starts popping up ever more intrusive reminders to renew, pointing you to their site, where they want $79.99 for a year.  Renewing with this product on Amazon is half the price, and the renewal process is super simple.  Immediately after purchasing the digital content, click on the ""Your Games and Software Library Link"", and activate the product.  Then copy the (long) key shown.  Then in Norton security, click on Renew my subscription, then click on ""I have a key"" and enter the new key.  Sign into your Norton account to activate the new key, and you will have 366 more days.  One slightly annoying thing is that it does not give you credit for any remaining days on your old subscription, but considering that the renewal is half-off this is not a big deal.  There is no need to actually download anything or uninstall any old versions.",B015724OVG,/gp/customer-reviews/RL2WGHNFSDX8W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015724OVG,"November 10, 2015",780

I am not sure what happened, but when we downloaded this file and attempted to install it on our computer, we got a fictitious warning from someone posing as a Norton representative saying that our software could not be installed because our network had been hacked and we had 16 unauthorized users on our account from a URL somewhere in Ohio.  What ensued was a 3 hour scramble to clean our network and install a 3rd party anti-hacking program to protect our network....  and the whole thing turned out to be a scam.  We verified with Norton direct that it was a scam, the individual we talked to was not employed by Norton, and his phone # was connected to a fraud ring in China.  If you get a pop up warning like this - ignore it and call Norton direct using their bona fide phone # (found online) and not the fake one on the pop up.

I paid for a 2 year subscription two years ago -- before upgrading my computer to Windows 10. After upgrading my computer to Windows 10, Norton updated my software from the old Norton 360 to Security Premium. It worked smoothly but coverage for 10 devices with added protection for families with children was simply overkill for a retired couple. I decided to save money by switching to the more affordable Norton Security Deluxe. I chatted online with a Norton agent in order to receive advice on the best way to remove Premium and install deluxe. The helpful agent offered to do it for me by taking control of my computer. That was probably my big mistake. After the Norton agent removed Premium and installed Deluxe on my desktop computer I chose to do the same by myself on my laptop computer. The laptop has no issues but the Deluxe installation performed by the Norton rep has some serious problems. I returned to Norton support. Three different technicians spent a combined 3 hours and 15 minutes on my computer and have been unable to leave me with a successful installation. Their final solution was to tell me I would have to create a new User account on my computer and delete my old one. I started that process but have run into some serious challenges in creating an alternate account that will successfully handle our Outlook accounts and successfully network with my other computer.

I explained the situation to them and they were very apologetic.  Norton told me that I could get one year coverage on 10 PC's for $49.99 and that as a matter of good faith on their part, they would sell me this coverage for only $25.00.

It provides protection with minimal processor impact on the computer or phone. Note that if you use an iPhone many experts say ANY protection suite provides little benefit due to the iPhone's native compartmentalization of apps and iOS operating system. I use Norton on desktop and laptop computers, and on Android smartphones, but not on iPhones.The only real nuisance I've seen is the reminders and ads that appeared on an Android phone, that I could not block. It is tolerable.BEWARE come renewal time. When you setup your Norton account it will likely enable automatic renewal which would be done directly with Norton. Their renewal price may be much higher than purchasing a new license from Amazon. For example, I was offered a renewal price of $89.99 + tax when Amazon was selling it at $24.99 + tax. Yes - the exact same product!There are two options: (1) Call Norton and see if they will price match the renewal. (2) Buy a new license from Amazon. If you buy the new license note the wording in the product description. The new license does NOT add onto your current subscription. So you should activate it shortly before your current subscription ends and reinstall the software with the new activation codes.For either (1) or (2) you probably need to deactivate automatic renewal on the soon-to-expire account. Be prepared - Norton will take you through about five ""are you really sure?"" screens.So I recommend the product.

So I purchased and installed this on my Macbook using Safari.  Its scan showed I had no problems, but the redirect persisted.  Also, it's extension (""Norton needs to add the Norton Security Extension to Safari,"" says the pop up window) was scary.  It warns that it will be able to see passwords, credit card numbers etc.  Maybe this is nothing, but I'm not tech savvy enough to not be anxious about it.I started a chat, as the 24/7 phone number for Norton support disconnected after the automated voice answered every time I called.  In chat, we ran the scan again, nothing detected, again.  Then, the chat helper suggested clearing my computer's history.  That fixed the redirect problem.Now for the final straw, I resumed my online searches, but I got Safari error notice saying Safari couldn't connect to page.  I was trying to go to Yelp.  So I tried several other web addresses--same message.  I've already spent far more time with this software than any other I've ever installed.  It didn't fix my initial problem, and now I have a greater problem.  If I eliminate the Norton Extension, I can once again visit any website.  If I add it, which I'd prefer not to, I cannot connect to multiple safe websites.

When we bought our first computer, in the last century, we were offered a free anti-virus product. Shortly thereafter, we got a virus on our computer, so I started looking for something better. I found Norton and we have used their products ever since. There are so many new viruses found every week and I really do not think Norton, or any other product on the market is foolproof. I have used some other versions of Norton, and I was not as pleased. One year I even tried a more deluxe version, and I went back to this basic internet Security. I purchase a new version every year.I prefer to use the download version, and I like ordering through Amazon for several reasons:One is that it is the full licensed version, not a cheap replica and not a used version.Another benefit is that I can re-download it to my computer is I have to do a system restore or if I replace the computer. I think the basic version is allowed to download on five devises now. It used to be three devices and that was enough, but as our family’s internet protection needs have grown so have Norton’s coverage.Also, I don’t have to keep up with a box. My code is stored in my Amazon purchases and I can re-download whenever I need to. One year I purchased directly through Norton and lost my product code and couldn’t find my password to login to Norton’s website. It was not a simple thing to just reset my password, but a real hassle.One year I ordered the wrong product, and Amazon allowed me to change it to the Norton version I wanted. That doesn’t usually happen with any company that you purchase downloaded products through. For me, Amazon makes it a no risk purchase.Finally, and probably the greatest incentive is the cost factor. Amazon sells the same great Norton products at a greatly discounted price.As I said, I don’t think there’s anything perfect in the internet security world, but for many years I have been pleased with Norton and plan to continue to use their product.Norton Security Deluxe - 5 Devices [Download Code]",B015724OVG,/gp/customer-reviews/R2DBXIA51UFB2L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015724OVG,"May 28, 2016",2

That is good, but admin with control of settings, I should be able to add this to exceptions but even after I do, it still gives me problems.I am coming from using Kaspersky, and by far, still Kaspersky is the best experience I have had.

I haven’t notice it detecting malware within zip / tar / iso, etc.)- Stays up to dateAnyways, sorry, but even though I was trying to get away from Kaspersky, I also did not want to go to Norton because of my past experience with using it.

I had 2015 360 installed and had no problem renewing through the Amazon process. I have had a Norton account set up for decades and it is through them that you update. Once you have purchased and added your download version to your Amazon software library you simple click on the link ""how to redeem this product"" which gives you a link to Norton and lists the few steps required. Norton takes over from there and recolonizes your current version and removes it. Yes you have to be patient and let it work and respond to a few prompts and reboot once but it is simple and straight forward process that may take fifteen minutes max. Don't forget to run live update a couple or three times after the install says it is finished. I had sixteen updates and a patch then one more update.

Joanna D.,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGCMGSIU7CZGMDAPUWC4SVDR6YSA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,"5 devices is skimpy, buy the Premium version",4,Verified Purchase,"Platform: Download Code [12 Month, with Auto-Renewal]Edition: 5 Device","This is the latest revision of Norton Security. I've used several others including McAfee and Trend Micro but I think I'm standardizing on this brand out of familiarity. The Deluxe version handles 5 devices. I'd really suggest you use the Norton Security Premium - 10 Devices [Download Code] because you can fill up 5 devices quickly (desktop, laptop, your spouse's--there's three or four, kids....) and it has a few more features for not a whole lot more. In retrospect, I should have bought that one but Norton can be confusing to buy. I should knock off a star for that confusion, but over all, I can recommend this software. As it is, I've rated it four stars because really, the Premium is the one I should have bought for a few bucks more. If you cover your phones and your tablets, you'll need 10 device capacity, no doubt about it.I also should knock a star off for installation: I broke a regular rule of mine--de-install before installing new, but I followed the on-screen directions and it didn't say to do that. However, as I was upgrading from the 2015 and a different version (I had premium before, see how confused I got?) I should have de-installed. To upgrade from 2015 to 2016 SAME product (ie deluxe to deluxe or premium to premium) you don't need to de-install. It's hard to remember what you did previously and the words ""deluxe"" and ""premium"" are easy to confuse.So I had to chat with the tech support when my install ground to a halt. I couldn't proceed. Something seemed wrong--and it was. The chat person (possibly out of Palo Alto) was absolutely marvelous. We stepped through the re-installation after de-install by having her do remote-PC and at several points, watching the chat for when you have to re-enter your password (encrypted) because the tech can't do that, nor should they. It did take the 45 minutes she told me it would, and afterwards, my install was perfect--because it was handled by Norton. I give five stars to the tech support chat and no stars to the installation protocol, which should have checked for previous versions and suggested de-installation.I did feel kind of stupid, but then last week, I did a flawless hardware malfunction diagnosis and repair on my same laptop so I guess ""D'oh!"" and ""Woo-hoo!"" canceled each other out.Bottom line: Unless you have to save that six bucks, buy the Premium. You will be happier. Check previous versions of anti-virus. If it isn't the same product, de-install the old product before installing this one. I actually believe that would apply to competing software as well.",B015724OVG,/gp/customer-reviews/R239HW1TBOM8Z5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015724OVG,"June 11, 2016",6

Norton has always protected my computers from viruses and is easy to setup. It is also easy to manage and set preferences. It is always scanning or providing warnings about websites. Runs in the background on my laptop and doesn't interfere with anything that I am doing or working on. The problem is, as almost every other reviewer has already mentioned, that it is advertised as security for your PC, Mac, smartphones, and tablets. This is not true. It is a full version of Norton on PCs (and probably Macs, I do not use a Mac so I am not completely sure), but on smartphones and tablets it is simply an app that can back up your contacts and help locate your device. Installing it on your phone/tablet takes away one of the five devices allowed, and it is pointless. I have an iPhone and it already backs up my contacts to the cloud and has a 'find my iphone' feature. There is no security for your device at all.If you buy this product, just be aware that it is only for a computer. I would pay the $19.99 just to protect my computer, but it is very disappointing when you believe that all your devices can be protected, and they are not. The description needs to state that smartphones and tablets are only getting a pointless app. Instead, it claims to protect your device if you pay bills on it or use banking apps. I would give it 5 stars if it just was listed as for computers, because it does what it claims to do in regards to that though.

Namely, every time I try to do a live update or run a scan it’s a 50/50 chance it won’t work. Norton’s initial solution to this longstanding problem was to uninstall Norton then reinstall. That worked for a few live updates, then back to the same issue. Now, after a lengthy wait, a screen pops up notifying you that Norton found a problem, but fixed it. Really! Sometimes it now works. Sometimes not. Sometimes a reboot gets it working again. Sometimes not. When this occurs, are you protected and just not able to update and scan? Or is the problem deeper?  Who knows, but the problem, in my case, continues on multiple systems as of 4-24-16.Another issue I have been having with Norton, is that an upgrade to bios or a change in motherboard often leads to the license disappearing, and requires purchasing a new one. For these reasons, I am fast losing my enthusiasm for Norton products.Fullow up on 6-20-16In my ongoing experience, with 3 new Windows 10 desktops, Norton appears to be unable to work RELIABLY with Windows 10. It works for a while, then it goes “missing in action.”  At this point left click, right click, do what you want, to the Norton icon - it does nothing. No way to live update or scan. Is it providing any protection.? No way to know. Eventually, if you wait long enough a popup appears telling you Norton has a problem. Yes, I know that. That’s why I’m researching a different product. The end result is always an Error: ""8504,104,” which requires a reinstall of Norton. I have lost track of how often I have done this reinstall. This fixes the problem for a few days. Then it’s back to square one. By now, 6-20-16, don’t you think they should have fixed this? For this reason, and due the fact that Norton has not indicated whether or not Norton Security is actually providing any protection when this Error: ""8504,104"" is occurring, I am lowering my rating to 1 star.7-11-2016: Once again, I turn on my computer and Norton security is not working! I go through the whole rigmarole one more time. For those not familiar, here it is:Run the Norton Remove and Reinstall toolIf you have Norton Family installed, uninstall it before you run the Norton Remove and Reinstall tool.1. Download the Norton Remove and Reinstall tool.Save the file to the Windows desktop. On some browsers, the file is automatically saved to its default location.1. To open the Downloads window in your browser, press the Ctrl + J key.2. Double-click the NRnR icon.3. Read the license agreement, and click Agree.4. Click Advanced Options.5. Click Remove Only.6. Click Remove.7. Click Restart Now.After the computer restarts, follow the on-screen instructions to reinstall your Norton product.STEP 2Except, the reinstall feature does not work. So no Security – again. I go back to Amazon, and reinstall. And then have to reinstall all the security updates, with 2 restarts required, including one to fix the vulnerability the FBI recently notified us of. Is this any way for your security suite to work? If you think so, they buy Norton, but then do a lot of praying. Because 2 or 3 weeks from now, I will be doing this all over again - unless Norton decides to put out a product that RELIABLY works.",B015724OVG,/gp/customer-reviews/R1KVBM8DNRSZ8H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015724OVG,"April 24, 2016",19

For a while, starting about 10 years ago, I had swapped to one of the free antivirus utils instead, mostl;y because I'd noticed that what Norton was doing back then was eating up  too much of my system's capacity; when Norton 4ngaged, the whole mess slowed to a dead crawl.  Starting about four years ago, though, they improved their software a heck of a lot, and the system hit is far less now.  Unfortunately, the malware makers have been getting better at hiding their bombs inside email attachments, and the current Norton product often takes two to five days to find and neutralize those threats.  However, since I'm a suspicious old dude who has been around since before there were computer viruses at all, and I've got a well-honed sense of caution about attachme6nts, the hazard to me is near zero - as long as I never let anyone else use this system.  If Symantec can get that delay between emergence and detection down to something more useful, I'll happily upgrade this to five stars.

I ordered Norton Deluxe for my computer for 5 computers as I have for years. I tried to activate the software and got a error message. I called the phone number to Norton. I ended up in India as usual. After a long conservation I found out that my computer had a possible infection of some kind with some bad drivers and that their system would not accept data from my computer. I was also informed that I needed to have a certified Microsoft Tech go over my computer every 60 to 90 days to keep it running properly.They could remove the problems from my system for $200. I requested to talk to someone in the US. I was transferred and it sounded like I had made it to someone I could understand. After a couple of minutes I was back in India again. This one was a supervisor. After another conversation about my problems and asking if I was a senior I got a price of $150 for 5 machines for a year. I will not recommend Norton to anyone any more. This is the first time I have run into anything like this. I tried to activate the software on another computer that had 10 installed by the factory and it will not load. Evidently they have blocked the code. It is to late to ask for a refund from Amazon. This another hard lesson. Be careful when buying Norton.

Previously, you could bring up the Norton screen, click on Renew, the click on ""Have Product Code"", simply enter the code and within seconds, your subscription was renewed to 365 days.  That option no longer exists.  When you click on Renew, it directs you to their page where you have to purchase it from them.  I contacted Norton, and they told me to sign onto Norton.com/setup and enter the product key.  At that point, it goes through and entire download and installation process.  I have not yet figured out how to get it on to additional devices since it is a 5 device version, but I suspect that same process of download and install will be required.  This is a big pain!!  I can't believe a company as great as Norton has stooped to this level to try to force you to buy directly from them.  Very disappointed.

I have been using it for over 2 months now and don't think I can last the other 10 until my year subscription is up. It was a daily special for a great price and my McAfee was expiring in a few weeks so I figured why not, the timing is great. I didn't have a problem with McAfee, but I figured most of these products are about the same. HAHA. No. The biggest issue is about the Live Update. First off, it doesn't do it automatically even though it's set to do to it automatically. Secondly the automatic scan is a quick high level scan. I figured how to get a full system scan set up to run weekly. Third is a huge problem that combines the first and second issue. If the full scan starts to run and the latest updates aren't install not only does your computer freeze up, but the dreaded blue screen of death hits. And they know it's a thing, it's on a ton of forums and their solution is to make sure all the updates are installed before running a full scan. Errrr, why doesn't the automatic update do it's job and then this entire problem goes away?!  How protected is my computer not knowing if the antivirus software is current? The quick scan running in the background doesn't really do anything if it's not scanning against the most current problems.  This product is awful.

I'm sure it provides a fair amount of virus protection which I did give an extra star for.  But the way-too-frequent nags about installing things I DON'T WANT are extremely annoying.  When I tell it NOT to install one of their other plug-ins or programs, I should NOT be nagged about it every day!  No matter how many times I click the ""Never ask me again"" button, it still doesn't listen and nags me again the next day.It also requires a restart, it seems, with every update to the database.  This is just poor software management.  The core engine should not be changing that much just to access new virus updates.  The older versions managed a much better balance between requiring complete system reboots and simply updating the new virus definitions and letting you continue to work without constant updates to reboot the computer.So you get (hopefully) a fair amount of protection at a very high price of annoyance.Time to look elsewhere for a good virus protection program that doesn't require so much 'maintenance'.",B015724OVG,/gp/customer-reviews/R37Q5W063Y3R0B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015724OVG,"December 12, 2017",

I have gotten by with free software. I always felt like I was missing something and felt uneasy about the security I was receiving. I saw a deal on Amazon for Norton on 5 devices for $20 for a year. That was a great deal that I couldn't pass up on. The software itself is easy to use. I like that I am able to add my cell phone as well. In the end, I don't see much benefit to having it on my phone. It just tells me everything I use is a risk. In reality, I probably only need this on one device and would have rather spent $5. However, it was the same price for 1 device as it was for 5. As of now, the price is back up to $40. I personally would not purchase again at $20, so I definitely wouldn't recommend $40.

Purchased Norton Security Deluxe for a new desktop. Computer was working perfectly until I installed Norton. I ran a 'quick scan' and no issues were identified. But at that moment...immediately..the computer stopped operating. Clicked on Google and page never loaded even after waiting 30 minutes!  Had to shutdown computer and since that installation the computer will not even reboot!! Norton customer no-service was unable to help and claimed it wasn't their problem...basically said too bad sucker!! They don't take responsibility for trashing my computer.

I have tried McAfee and others a couple of times, but still prefer the Norton. Perhaps this is for subjective reasons, but in all my experience, Norton has never let anything into my machines (and I am a dangerously curious, although not gullible user). My biggest criticism of Norton is that it tries to do too much for you, giving you the feeling that your computer exists for Norton. Also, Norton would love for you to opt for the automatic renewal, in which you will get billed for full factory price (currently around $90) while they pretend to be giving you the best deal. Just buying a new authorization code (a subscription in effect) here is a much better deal, and using the code to update for another year works fine for me (I have been doing this method for several years now after waking up to Norton's duplicitous marketing techniques).",B015724OVG,/gp/customer-reviews/RGIV1EZFDRL1C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015724OVG,"April 22, 2017",

About a week ago, my computer started to become sluggish and barely usable. It turns out that Norton (ns.exe) would begin to run uncontrollably (37% of an 8 core i7 processor).  It would also increase memory usage to over 90% cause the computer to page memory to the hard drive.  I did some searching online, including Norton's community, and saw that Norton had this same issue earlier this year and claimed that it had been fixed.  Some online users claimed that their CPUs or CPU fans failed due to the non-stop running caused by Norton.  I refuse to spend my free time debugging someone else's software, so the easiest thing for me to do was to uninstall Norton and then install a product that works.

The advertisement/explanations/photos are ambiguous. I am trying to understand if Norton wants to protect me, why sell antivirus software without the backup utility. I am not safe unless my data is backed up as well. I spent $25 on the antivirus software to find out that the backup utility is on another product that I would have happily purchased had I understood the game. Since Norton doesn't sell just the backup utility (I AM SHOCKED!), now I have to upgrade and spend $45 more. I just wasted $25 and I am EXTREMELY annoyed.

I'm talking about software that I had been using for years which had caused no problems. When I finally got that software restored (which took over an hour), I discovered Norton had rewarded me further by damaging several data files that had been deemed as ""dangerous"" which in reality represented hundreds of man hours of my personal work. Guess what? I had to devote several hundred MORE man hours to replace those files!!God forbid you ever try to install NEW SOFTWARE. Norton will severely punish you for even thinking that. It's not like PCs were actually built for using software or anything ....This morning, I reached the end of my rope after trying to run a Music Creation Software which informed me of an update. Norton determined that the update was evil and punished it accordingly. Sadly for me, the software license file got damaged and I'm going to have to pay $50 for another copy of that software. This Norton package seemed like a good deal at the time, but I've actually paid for it several times over when factoring in all the lost time, the extreme levels of irritation, and the damaged software I've had to replace.Ironic how Norton labels various files and software as ""dangerous"" and ""evil"" which actually Norton is the evil one. It's like a Trojan Horse - which is what it should've been named from the start. I can think of better names, but those would probably get my review deleted.Don't buy this software, you can certainly find better ways to waste your money - like at a slot machine or on a good drunk.",B015724OVG,/gp/customer-reviews/R3068OMGZ591U2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015724OVG,"February 17, 2016",12

It offers you $4.15 worth of extra protection in hopes that you will automatically renew, and do not notice that it is going to increase anywhere from $10-20, as was the case with Norton 360. First, if you have an older Norton program, you must have it uninstalled, which the new program will do for you, but it will take up time. The interface of the program is still identical to the Norton 360 program, it features the same type of protection that was offered with Norton 360, and there is no difference in speed, options, or features that this so-called new protection software offers, that was not offered with Norton 360. Why is it that Norton, as well as Amazon, waste the customer's time with introducing the same product under a new name, with the same old features that it had before? The only thing that might be worthy, is that it is now offered $10 cheaper than it was, but if you bought it before the decrease, you are not offered a refund of the difference!",B015724OVG,/gp/customer-reviews/RYNVRNBUT6A3J/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015724OVG,"July 31, 2016",3

This item proved to be a total failure.  I tried to load onto my desktop and I got a message that it couldn't download.  (Never have had any problems downloading anything from Amazon).  I contacted Norton and got this guy who remotely got on my computer to try to help me download but was unable.  He then went somewhere in the computer to start checking some things out and then proceeded to tell me that my computer had been hacked, etc. etc.  Then he told me that he would have to forward my problem to some technical team so that they could go in my computer to correct all the problems and I would be charged for the services.  At that point I told him to forget it.  I wasn't about to spend hundreds of dollars for nothing.  I started looking on line and found out that companies will do or say that just so they can charge you more money.  I don't believe he was telling me the truth and the fact is that I haven't had any problems with my computer and there's absolutely no sign that I've been hacked by anyone.  It's been over a year and I've not seen any problems with any of my credit accounts or anything on my computer.  My bank account shows no sign of anything happening to it, so I think that my computer was never tampered with at all.  I'm just out for the cost of the download...

The ""update"" is equally ridiculous. The entire update time is about 1 minute or less. What can the program possibly protect with a 1 minute or less download and install. I got online to Norton via chat with my issues. They gave me generic responses that were useless. I finally asked if this program functions via the cloud, rather than via updates to my computer. I was told yes - it functions via the cloud - and I am no fan of cloud functions. The back of the box stated that the product has a 60-day money back guarantee. How is it then that a retail establishment refuses to refund the charge, and Symantec's online chat refuses to provide assistance in getting the refund, or even mentioning its existence when a customer says the product is not acceptable and wants a refund.

I did because it worked well back than. But now and then, it doesn't actually work as strongly as it has claimed to have worked, and that has left more of vulnerability than met the eye. That hasn't changed, and with Norton Security Deluxe, it has had the same flaws where it doesn't work strongly, and takes too much room on my computer hard drive to where it doesn't run as smoothly as my computer once did.
